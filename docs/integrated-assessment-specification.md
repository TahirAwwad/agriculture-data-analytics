## Learning Outcomes:

Please note this is not the assessment task. The task to be completed is detailed in [assessment-criteria.md](assessment-criteria.md). This CA will assess student attainment of the following minimum intended learning outcomes:

### Programming for Data Analytics

1. Debate the selection of programming concepts in the design of programmatic solutions, in terms of paradigm and language selection. (Linked to PLO 1).
2. Design and implement algorithms for use within the context of data analytics. (Linked to PLO 2).
3. Critically appraise aggregation methods to process and manipulate data from multiple data structures. (Linked to PLO 3).
4. Formulate and evaluate a test and optimization strategy for programmatic solutions. (Linked to PLO 5).
5. Compare, contrast and select relevant libraries / techniques to process data from diverse sources. (Linked to PLO 5).

### Statistics for Data Analytics

1. Formulate and test hypotheses using appropriate statistical techniques and evaluate and communicate the result effectively. (Linked to PLO 2, PLO 3, PLO6).
2. Utilise current software and language to produce the results of your analysis from existing data. (Linked to PLO 1, PLO 4).
3. Apply statistical analysis to appropriate datasets to find correlations and critique the limitations of the model. (Linked to PLO 2, PLO4).

### Machine Learning for Data Analysis

1. Modify and implement Machine Learning Algorithms to solve analytical problems. (Linked to PLO 1, PLO 2, PLO 5)
2. Determine whether a given data analysis problem requires the use of supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised learning methods. Develop and implement the chosen learning method. (Linked to PLO 1, PLO 2, PLO 4)
3. Develop a machine learning strategy for a given domain and communicate effectively to team members, peers and project stakeholders the insight to be gained from the interpreted results. (Linked to PLO 1, PLO 4, PLO 6)
4. Implement a range of classification and regression techniques and detail / document their suitability for a variety of problem domains. (Linked to PLO 5)

### Data Preparation & Visualization

1. Discuss the concepts, techniques and processes underlying data visualization to critically evaluate visualization approaches with respect to their suitability for different problem areas. (linked to PLO 1)
2. Programmatically Implement graphical methods to identify issues within a data set (missing, out of range, dirty data) (linked to PLO 3, PLO 5)
3. Engineer new features selection in data with the goal of improving the performance of machine learning models. (linked to PLO 2, PLO 4)
4. Propose, design, develop, and implement an interactive data visualization solution, for a given data set and potential audience,  detailing the rationale for approach and visualization choices made during development for a given use case, data characteristics and multiple transmission media (Linked to PLO 2, PLO 5)
5. Collaboratively perform a critical analysis of a data set to optimise the data for a given problem space. Document the rationale behind the group’s decisions to peers and stakeholders.(linked to PLO 5, PLO 6)

> Attainment of the learning outcomes is the minimum requirement to achieve a Pass mark (40%). Higher marks are awarded where there is evidence of achievement beyond this, in accordance with QQI *Assessment and Standards, Revised 2013*, and summarized in the following table:

|**Percentage Range**|**CCT Performance Description**|**QQI Description of Level 9 award Attainment**|
|-|-|-|
|90% +|Exceptional|Achievement includes that required for a Pass and in **most** respects is significantly and consistently beyond this|
|80 – 89%|Outstanding|&nbsp;|
|70 – 79%|Excellent|&nbsp;|
|60 – 69%|Very Good|Achievement includes that required for a Pass and in **many** respects is significantly beyond this|
|50 – 59%|Good|Attains all the minimum intended programme learning outcomes|
|40 – 49%|Acceptable|&nbsp;|
|35 – 39%|Fail|Nearly (but not quite) attains the relevant minimum intended learning outcomes|
|0 – 34%|Fail|Does not attain some or all of the minimum intended learning outcomes|

Please review the CCT Grade Descriptor available on the module Moodle page for a detailed description of the standard of work required for each grade band.  

The grading system in CCT is the QQI percentage grading system and is in common use in higher education institutions in Ireland. The pass mark and thresholds for different grade bands may be different from what you have experienced in the higher education system in other countries. CCT grades must be considered in the context of the grading system in Irish higher education and not assumed to represent the same standard the percentage grade reflects when awarded in an international context.
