EarthStat.org serves geographic data sets with the purpose of solving the grand challenge of feeding a growing global population while reducing agriculture's impact on the environment.

### Copernicus

[https://www.copernicus.eu/en
](URL)

Copernicus is the European Union's Earth observation programme, looking at our planet and its environment to benefit all European citizens. It offers information services that draw from satellite Earth Observation and in-situ (non-space) data.

The European Commission manages the Programme. It is implemented in partnership with the Member States, the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), EU Agencies and Mercator Océan.

Vast amounts of global data from satellites and ground-based, airborne, and seaborne measurement systems provide information to help service providers, public authorities, and other international organisations improve European citizens' quality of life and beyond. The information services provided are free and openly accessible to users.

**Land Cover: version 2, 100m resolution, globe, epoch 2015**

**Last update: Tue, 31/03/2020 - 20:53**

Land cover maps represent spatial information on different types (classes) of physical coverage of the Earth's surface, e.g. forests, grasslands, croplands, lakes, wetlands. Dynamic land cover maps include transitions of land cover classes over time and hence captures land cover changes.

Related Land Use maps contain spatial information on the arrangements, activities and inputs people undertake in a certain land cover type to produce, change or maintain it.  This collections includes the global land cover maps of Collection 2, at 100m resolution, for base year 2015. These consist of different layers: the base classification with 23 classes, fractional cover (0-100% per pixel) for the main classes and related quality information (e.g. probabilities, input data density).

### Food security:

**Definition**: Food security, as defined by the United Nations’ Committee on World Food Security, means that all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their food preferences and dietary needs for an active and healthy life.

IMF Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS)

](URL)

The Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS) presents current figures on the value of merchandise exports and imports disaggregated according to a country’s primary trade partners. Area and world aggregates are included in the display of trade flows between major areas of the world. Reported data is supplemented by estimates whenever such data is not available or current. Imports are reported on a cost, insurance and freight (CIF) basis and exports are reported on a free on board (FOB) basis, with the exception of a few countries for which imports are also available FOB. Time series data includes estimates derived from reports of partner countries for non-reporting and slow-reporting countries.

**Geographic Coverage:** DOTS covers all IMF member states, some non-member countries, the world, and major areas.

**Temporal Coverage:** Monthly and quarterly data are available starting 1960. Annual data are available starting 1947.

### Economist Global Food Security Index

The Global Food Security Index (GFSI) considers the issues of food affordability, availability, quality and safety, and natural resources and resilience across a set of 113 countries. The index is a dynamic quantitative and qualitative benchmarking model constructed from 58 unique indicators that measure the drivers of food security across both developing and developed countries. 

The 2020 edition of the GFSI incorporated the "Natural Resources and Resilience" category into the main index. This category assesses a country’s exposure to the impacts of a changing climate; its susceptibility to natural resource risks; and how the country is adapting to these risks, all of which impact the incidence of food insecurity in a country. The category was first introduced into the GFSI in 2017 as an adjustment factor and, given its increasing importance, was mainstreamed for the first time in the 2020 edition.

**An in-situ area frame survey**

LUCAS is an in-situ area frame survey, which means that the **data are gathered through direct observations** made by surveyors in the field. Land cover data can also be obtained by interpreting satellite images or orthophotos, as is done in the Corine land cover inventory.

LUCAS points belong to the intersections of a 2 km grid that includes around **1 million points all over the EU**. During the LUCAS 2018 survey, a sample of around 240 000 of these points is visited on the spot by 750 field surveyors, whilst another 98 000 points are photo-interpreted in the office. The points are selected on the basis of stratification information.

**Fully standardised data**

The land cover/use statistics derived from the LUCAS survey are unique as they are fully standardised to use the **same definitions and methodology**, and are comparable among Member States.

Types of land cover and visible land use are broken down into harmonised LUCAS categories. The full supporting documents for the survey comprise a field form, where all the measured variables are listed, and detailed field surveyors' instructions, which describe quality control procedures. The full description of the statistical data set is available in the land cover/use statistics metadata.

**The soil module**

As in the 2009 and 2015 surveys, the LUCAS 2018 survey includes a soil module, where a topsoil sample is collected at 10 % of the points. The objective of the soil module is to improve the availability of harmonised data on soil parameters in Europe. The LUCAS soil module was implemented in cooperation with the Directorate-General for Environment and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.

Food Balance Sheet

[https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=1014](URL)

Definition: A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period. The food balance sheet shows for each food item - i.e. each primary commodity and a number of processed commodities potentially available for human consumption - the sources of supply and its utilization.
