# Assessment Criteria

> "Why don’t people look up and move ahead? The answer is, well, you start formulating an ideal, and you formulate a judge. It’s pretty easy to feel intimidated in the face of your own ideal. That’s what happens to Cain versus Abel, for example. Then it’s really easy to destroy the ideal instead of trying to pursue it, because then you get rid of the judge." - [Dr Jordan B Peterson, 2017](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/transcripts/biblical-series-xi/)

Students are advised to review and adhere to the submission requirements document after the assessment task.  

## Scenario

"Agriculture hasn't always been an industry people associate with big data analytics or data centres, but that's changing. From time immemorial, farmers have been quick to turn to new technologies that allow them to improve their crop yields and work more efficiently. As big data analytics have become more widely available across industries, many farmers and companies in the agricultural sector are using those tools in an effort to become more productive and competitive." (Mathews K, 2019)  

Your Group has been tasked with analyzing Ireland's Agricultural data and comparing the Irish Agriculture sector with other countries worldwide. This analysis should also include forecasting, sentiment analysis and evidence-based recommendations for the sector as well as a complete rationale of the entire process used to discover your findings. Your Research could include (but not excluding any other topic EXCEPT Climate change), export, import, trade imbalance, arable production, animal stock, medicinal input, organic, gm products etc. with Ireland as your base line.  

**Note: While topical, Agricultural impact on Climate Change should not be chosen as an area of research for this assessment.**  

Your Group must source appropriate data sets from any available repository to inform your research (all datasets MUST be referenced, and the relevant license/permissions detailed).

## Criteria of Analysis

- Discuss the choice of project management framework you have deemed suitable for this project.
- Evidence of project planning and team division in terms of roles and responsibilities, task allocation, collaboration etc. Must be demonstrated within the report.
- The inclusion of a reflective piece from each group member should accompany the submission (this may be attached as appendix items)

### Grading scheme
- In addition to the rubric supplied above up to 30% of the available marks may be allocated on an individual contributory basis.  
- Groups are encouraged to detail their contribution and their collaboration within their reflective pieces.  

### Programming

- The project must be explored programmatically, this means that you must implement suitable Python tools (code and/or libraries) to complete the analysis required. All of this is to be implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Your code-book should be properly annotated.
- The project documentation must include sound justifications and explanations of your code choices.
- Make sure to incorporate as many of the tools studied in class as possible, such as data persistency (file-based or databases), user interfaces to present your results in an interactive manner, or data pulling from external APIs.  

### Statistics

- Analyse the variables in your dataset(s) and use appropriate inferential statistics to gain insights on possible population values (e.g., if you were working with international commerce, identify the average/variance exportation yearly/quarterly in the appropriate currency).  

- Undertake research to find similarities between some countries against Ireland and apply parametric and non-parametric inferential statistics techniques to compare them (e.g., analysis of variance, t-test, Wilcoxon test, among others).  

- Use the outcome of your analysis to deepen your research. Indicate the challenges you faced in the process.  

- You are expected to use at least 5 different inferential statistics techniques.  

- Use of descriptive statistics and appropriate visualizations are required to explain the scenario and justify the chosen models performed.  

- All your calculations and reasoning behind your models must be documented in the report and/or the appendix.  

### Machine Learning

Use of multiple models (at least three) to compare and contrast results and insights gained.  

- Describe the rationale and justification for the choice of machine learning models for the above-mentioned scenario.
- Machine Learning models can be used for Prediction, Classification, Clustering, sentiment analysis, recommendation systems and Time series analysis. Your group should plan on trying multiple approaches (at least three) with proper selection of hyper-parameters using GridSearchCV method. You can choose appropriate features from the datasets and a target feature to answer the question asked in the scenario.
- Collect and develop a dataset based on the agriculture topic related to Ireland as well as other parts of the world. Perform a sentimental analysis for an appropriate agricultural topic (e.g., product price, feed quality etc…) for producers and consumers point of view in Ireland.
- Your group should train and test for Supervised Learning and other appropriate metrics for unsupervised Machine learning models that you have chosen. Use cross validation to provide authenticity of the modelling outcomes.
- You are free to apply dimensionality reduction methods to prepare the dataset based on your machine learning modelling requirements.
- A Table or graphics should be provided to illustrate the similarities and contrast of the Machine Learning modelling outcomes based on the scoring metric used for the analysis. Discuss your understanding clearly.

### Data Preparation & Visualization

- Discuss in detail the process of acquiring your raw data, detailing the positive and/or negative aspects of your research and acquisition. This should include the relevance and implications of any and all licensing/permissions associated with the data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis helps to identify patterns, inconsistencies, anomalies, missing data, and other attributes and issues in data sets so problems can be addressed. Evaluate your raw data and detail, in depth, the various attributes and issues that you find. Your evaluation should reference evidence to support your  chosen methodology and use visualizations to illustrate your findings.
- Taking into consideration the tasks required in the machine learning section, use appropriate data cleaning, engineering, extraction and/or other techniques to structure and enrich your data. Rationalize your decisions and implementation, including evidence of how your process has addressed the problems identified in the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) stage and how your structured data will assist in the analysis stage. This should include visualizations to illustrate your work and evidence to support your methodology.
- Modern farming has a great dependence on technology and relies upon visualizations to communicate information, this includes web based, mobile based and many other digital transmission formats. Develop an interactive dashboard tailored to modern farmers, using tufts principles, to showcase the information/evidence gathered following your Machine Learning Analysis. Detail the rationale for approach and visualization choices made during development. **Note you may not use Power BI, RapidMiner, tableau or other such tools to accomplish this (at this stage).**

### *Additional notes*:

- Your documentation should present your group approach to the project, including elements of project planning (task allocation / timelines).
- Ensure that your documentation follows a logical sequence through the planning / research / justification / implementation phases of the project.
- Each group member must also create a reflective journal, detailing their own contribution to the project and reflections on the process (Note all reflections should be professional and polite). This should be a progressive document that will include reference to the individual student’s basecamp activity. 
- Ensure that your final upload contains only a maximum of 1 Jupyter notebook per task section and ideally a max of 5 overall. Please ensure that additional resources are placed and linked to a logical file structure e.g., Scripts, Images, Report, Data etc…
- Ensure that you include your raw and structured datasets in your submission.
- Two report templates have been provided as examples to show how the report may be structured, you are not required to use either one, they are examples only as every project is different.

**(It is expected that research be carried out beyond class material)**
