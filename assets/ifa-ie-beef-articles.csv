<h2>Sheep Update</h2>
<p>IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said the market conditions that underpinned the sheep trade for the past two years look set to continue for 2022. “Demand for sheep meat in China will continue to drive the global trade as New Zealand and Australia focus on supplying this lucrative market. Consumption of sheep meat in China has increased by 9% since 2018,” he said. This change in supply pattern has resulted in NZ filling only 46% of their EU quota, which is the lowest in decades.  This is increasing the opportunity for Irish exports. Sean Dennehy said the trade is predicted to hold steady over the coming months with supply and demand balanced, Easter and Ramadan in early April will be key drivers of the trade. Ongoing issues with UK access to the EU market will create openings for Irish lamb. The IFA Sheep Chairman said the relaxation to COVID-19 controls for the food service sector will increase demand for lamb in the domestic markets, and with COVID-19 cases falling, workforce issues will ease.</p>

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said the voting through of key amendments on animal transport in the European Parliament today goes some way towards safeguarding competition in the cattle trade.</p>
<p>Speaking from Strasbourg, Tim Cullinan said the debate showed there is more to be done to convince legislators that we are meeting the highest standards.</p>
<p>The IFA President acknowledged the work done by Irish MEPs to get backing in the European Parliament for the amendments.</p>
<p>“From the position of Irish farming, it was vital that the key amendments were carried, but our campaign will continue.  IFA will be working with others through COPA and our MEPs to build support for animal transport, given its critical role for Ireland as an island nation,” he said.</p>
<p>“Our calves are highly sought after in the European market.  They are very robust and healthy, and thrive well. Our animal welfare and transport are of the highest standard, which is why there is such demand for our calves,” he said.</p>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden, who is also in Strasbourg, said the recommendations from the ANIT Committee in the European Parliament for live animal transport had the potential to severely impact the competitive trade in this country, including the movements of in-calf animals, which is a key trade for farmers and marts.</p>
<p>“Irish farmers support and implement the highest welfare standards in the world and this includes the strictly controlled transport of animals.  Seeking to change the rules because other countries fail to implement them was not acceptable,” he said.</p>

<h2>Sheep Update</h2>
<p>Reacting to the recent sheep kills reported throughout the country over the Christmas period, IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said Government and the various state agencies with responsibility in this area continue to sit on their hands on the matter. IFA has met with Ministers Charlie McConalogue and Malcolm Noonan on the issue over the past year to have meaningful measures put in place to protect sheep farmers from the irresponsible behaviour of some dog owners. IFA launched a ‘No Dogs Allowed’ campaign in early 2021.  This campaign will continue until action is taken by Government to address this persistent problem. Sean Dennehy said the numbers of dog attacks on sheep is grossly under reported, due to the lack of action from authorities when sheep kills and sheep worrying are reported by farmers. This is unacceptable, government agencies with responsibility in this area must come forward with the necessary sanctions and controls for irresponsible dog owners he said.</p>

<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the recommendations from the ANIT Committee in the European Parliament for live animal transport has the potential to severely impact the competitive trade in this country.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said this approach is not acceptable and must be rejected by our MEPs when voted on in the full Parliament.</p>
<p>He said the unique island status of Ireland must also be recognised in any proposals in order to ensure Irish farmers continue to have unfettered access to the Single Market.</p>
<p>“Irish farmers support and implement the highest welfare standards in the world and this includes the strictly controlled transport of animals.  Seeking to change the rules because other countries fail to implement them is not acceptable,” he said.</p>
<p>“These proposals could be voted on next week. Our MEPs must ensure they are rejected and that the original compromise amendments are tabled and supported,” he said.</p>
<p>He said IFA is directly involved at EU level through Copa and with farm organisations from other member states in having these unnecessary recommendations rejected.</p>
<p>The recommendations are based on the outcome of poor enforcement of regulatory requirements in some regions of the EU.  Rather than focusing on better implementation, the Committee has put forward recommendations without scientific basis that penalise farmers in Ireland who implement transport measures that are equivalent to, or superior, to the existing requirements.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said these recommendations serve to remove competition from the sale of animals and create the potential for welfare issues by prohibiting transport of unweaned animals under 35 days of age and transport for unweaned calves over 35 days to a maximum of two hours.</p>
<p>The Livestock Chairman said the recommendation to prohibit the transport of in-calf animals within the last third of gestation will effectively change the landscape for farmers and marts in the sales of breeding females.</p>
<p>“Farmers have taken huge strides in raising the genetic profile of the breeding herd, providing efficiencies that will contribute to meeting our climate targets,” he said.</p>
<p>A critical component in raising the genetic merit of our breeding herds for farmers is the purchase of higher index replacement heifers. Suckler farmers in particular seek out the very best heifers in specialist sales of in calf heifers, these proposals will prohibit the sale of animals within three months of calving.</p>

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said the figures released by Bord Bia this morning for Irish food exports in 2021 show the importance of the sector to the Irish economy.</p>
<p>“Despite all the challenges, our exports grew by 4% to a record €13.5bn. This demonstrates the standing and reputation of our food, based on the raw materials produced by Irish farmers,” he said.</p>
<p>“With a massive increase in input costs – feed, energy and fertiliser – it’s critical that the price received by farmers increases across all sectors to help offset the extraordinary hike in the costs of production. It’s vital that the additional value generated by our food exports is delivered, in full, back to the farmer producing the raw material,” he said.</p>
<p>“Agriculture is our most important indigenous sector. It must be fostered and supported. Our economy is very dependent of foreign direct investment, but we must balance this with an increased focus on our indigenous sectors,” he said.</p>
<p>“We all acknowledge the need to continue to build on our environmental credentials, but we cannot do this at the expense of the economic sustainability of our primary producers,” he said.</p>
<p>“The current policy direction from the Irish Government is not striking the right balance between environmental, economic and social sustainability as set out in <em>Food Vision 2030</em>,” he said.</p>
<p>“The world will need more food and we are fortunate to have the climate and the expertise, built up on Irish farms over generations, to produce top quality food. We should be proud of this and work to support it, not undermine it,” he said.</p>

<h3>Beef Update </h3>
<p>The average price paid for R3 steers for the first 48 weeks of the year was €4.28/kg which is 46c/kg higher than the same period in 2020. Steer prices are 14% higher than they were in 2020, and 21% above the corresponding week in 2019. Global prices are strong, and across Europe, average R3 young bull prices have seen very strong growth rates in recent weeks. The Prime Irish composite price to-date this year increased by 12.6% on 2020 to €4.00/kg excl. vat, (€4.22/kg vat incl.) The Prime Export Benchmark price increased by 12.9% to €4.00/kg. Total cattle throughput has reached 1,643,719 up to week 50 of 2021. This is a 5% decline on 2020 figures. The overall reduction in supplies of 79,947 is running below the Bord Bia predicted decrease in supplies for the year and indicate the earlier slaughter of some animals which should contribute to tighter supplies in the early part of 2022.</p>

<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>Lamb prices in 2021 have performed well, with the average lamb price of €7.33/kg, up €1.48/kg on the 2020 average price for the first 48 weeks of the year or a 27% increase. Market demand for lamb in our key export markets has been strong due to the reduced volumes of New Zealand lamb. NZ imports to the EU are at the lowest levels in decades from a combination of focusing on the strong demand in China for sheep meat and shipping issues. Lamb prices in all the key lamb producing countries have remained strong throughout the year. Total throughput to week 50 is 2,639,281 head which is a 4% decrease when compared to the same period in 2020. Stronger lamb throughput in recent weeks has brought the Spring lamb kill to 5,558 above the same period in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Lamb Price Update 23/12/21</strong></p>
<p>Lamb €7.20/7.30/kg. Higher deals groups/larger lots. Weights to 23kgs. Ewes €3.10/3.55/kg. Sell hard.</p>

Beef Update 
The average price paid for R3 steers for the first 48 weeks of the year was €4.28/kg which is 46c/kg higher than the same period in 2020. Steer prices are 14% higher than they were in 2020, and 21% above the corresponding week in 2019. Global prices are strong, and across Europe, average R3 young bull prices have seen very strong growth rates in recent weeks. The Prime Irish composite price to-date this year increased by 12.6% on 2020 to €4.00/kg excl. vat, (€4.22/kg vat incl.) The Prime Export Benchmark price increased by 12.9% to €4.00/kg. Total cattle throughput has reached 1,643,719 up to week 50 of 2021. This is a 5% decline on 2020 figures. The overall reduction in supplies of 79,947 is running below the Bord Bia predicted decrease in supplies for the year and indicate the earlier slaughter of some animals which should contribute to tighter supplies in the early part of 2022.

Sheep Update
Lamb prices in 2021 have performed well, with the average lamb price of €7.33/kg, up €1.48/kg on the 2020 average price for the first 48 weeks of the year or a 27% increase. Market demand for lamb in our key export markets has been strong due to the reduced volumes of New Zealand lamb. NZ imports to the EU are at the lowest levels in decades from a combination of focusing on the strong demand in China for sheep meat and shipping issues. Lamb prices in all the key lamb producing countries have remained strong throughout the year. Total throughput to week 50 is 2,639,281 head which is a 4% decrease when compared to the same period in 2020. Stronger lamb throughput in recent weeks has brought the Spring lamb kill to 5,558 above the same period in 2020.

<h2>Beef Update</h2>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said our key markets in the UK and across Europe are performing well. The Bord Bia prime Irish composite price is 14c/kg behind the prime export benchmark price, which shows that our markets are delivering more than factories are paying to Irish finishers.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said prices have increased by 5c this week, heifers are making €4.30/kg to €4.45/kg, Steers are making from €4.25/kg to €4.40/kg. The Young bull trade has remained steady at €4.20-€4.40/kg for R/U grades respectively. Demand for cows remains strong and prices of €3.50/kg to €4.00/kg are available. </p>

Steers are making anywhere from €4.25/kg to €4.40/kg. Young bull trade has remained steady at €4.20-€4.40/kg for R/U grades respectively. Demand for cows remains strong and prices of €3.50/kg to €4.00/kg are available. </p>

<h2>Sheep Update</h2>
<p>IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said the option for the sheep factories to use Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) must be provided to farmers who prefer to be paid this way. IFA has met MII on this issue and set out farmers’ demands to have this facility provided, but to-date no lamb processing factories are offering this option to farmers. “We are seeing more and more rural services taken away.  The closure of local bank branches in towns throughout the country is making it more difficult for farmers to lodge cheques,” he said. Members of the IFA Sheep Committee contacted all of the sheep factories in the past few days.  While some are more positively disposed to providing the service, none is offering the facility despite IFA raising this issue with their representative body earlier this year. Sean Dennehy said it’s not acceptable that across the sheep processing industry, this payment option is not available.  He has called on all sheep processing factories to put the option in place. He said he will be formally writing to all of the sheep processing factories setting out the need to provide EFT and seeking a realistic timeframe to have this service for farmers.</p>

Beef Update 
IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said that prices have increased this week with heifers reaching prices of €4.30/kg to €4.45/kg in some cases. Steers are making anywhere from €4.25/kg to €4.40/kg. Young bull trade has remained steady at €4.20-€4.40/kg for R/U grades respectively. Demand for cows remains strong and prices of €3.50/kg to €4.00/kg are available. 
The IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said UK supplies are extremely tight, with the weekly kill running 10% behind last years levels, creating increased demand for Irish beef.
 “The EU young bull price and the UK steer price are above our current prices, creating an unacceptable and unjustified price gap of 17c/kg in the benchmark price” he said. 
Beef Price Update 10/12/21 
Steer Base €4.25/4.40kg. Heifers €4.30/4.45kg. Higher deals larger lots. Y Bulls R/U €4.20/4.40Kg. Cows €3.50/4.00kg.

<h2>Beef Update</h2>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said factories are not reflecting the strength of the market in prices to farmers, even though they went up by another 5c/kg this week. He said the latest Prime Export Benchmark price has opened up a gap of 17c/kg with the Prime Irish price, reflecting the strength of the market for beef. Brendan Golden said supplies of prime cattle are extremely tight.  Last week’s kill of steers came in at just over 13,000 head and the heifer kill dropped by over 800 head on the previous week to just over 10,000. “Factories are paying €4.25/kg for steers and €4.30/kg for heifers freely this week, with up to €4.40/kg paid for steers and €4.45/kg for heifers as they struggle to get suitable cattle,” he said. Cow prices are ranging from €3.50/kg to €4.00/kg depending on grade with young bulls grading R/U making €4.20/kg to €4.40/kg. Brendan Golden said there is no justification for prices lagging behind the Prime Export Benchmark Price by 17c/kg and factories must start returning the full value of the current market in beef prices offered to farmers.</p>

<h2>Sheep Update</h2>
<p>Commenting on the issuing of the advance payments for the 2021 Sheep Welfare Scheme (SWS), IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said the new reference periods are worth over €2m more for farmers in the scheme. He said the new reference periods for the scheme provide established flocks with the higher of 2017, or the original 2014/2015 reference years, for payment calculations. New entrants can use 2019 to reflect the process of establishing their flock. Sean Dennehy said the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue announced his intentions earlier this year to update the reference periods to better reflect the actual activity levels on sheep farms, following IFA’s calls to bring the reference periods up to date. “The Minister has honoured this commitment and provided the additional funding for this year’s and next year’s SWS, increasing payments to farmers by over €4m over the two-year period,” he said. Sean Dennehy said the focus must now be on building on this Scheme in the new CAP, to bring payments to €30/ewe. He said the current Strategic Plan lacks the funding and ambition to provide this and must be amended.</p>

Sheep Update
Commenting on the issuing of the advance payments for the 2021 Sheep Welfare Scheme (SWS), IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said the new reference periods are worth over €2m more for farmers in the scheme. He said the new reference periods for the scheme provide established flocks with the higher of 2017, or the original 2014/2015 reference years, for payment calculations. New entrants can use 2019 to reflect the process of establishing their flock. Sean Dennehy said the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue announced his intentions earlier this year to update the reference periods to better reflect the actual activity levels on sheep farms, following IFA’s calls to bring the reference periods up to date. “The Minister has honoured this commitment and provided the additional funding for this year’s and next year’s SWS, increasing payments to farmers by over €4m over the two-year period,” he said. Sean Dennehy said the focus must now be on building on this Scheme in the new CAP, to bring payments to €30/ewe. He said the current Strategic Plan lacks the funding and ambition to provide this and must be amended.

<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said factories are not reflecting the strength of the market in prices to farmers, even though they went up by another 5c/kg this week.</p>
<p>He said the latest Prime Export Benchmark price has opened up a gap of 17c/kg with the Prime Irish price, reflecting the strength of the market for beef.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said supplies of prime cattle are extremely tight.  Last week’s kill of steers came in at just over 13,000 head and the heifer kill dropped by over 800 head on the previous week to just over 10,000.</p>
<p>“Factories are paying €4.25/kg for steers and €4.30/kg for heifers freely this week, with up to €4.40/kg paid for steers and €4.45/kg for heifers as they struggle to get suitable cattle,” he said.</p>
<p>Cow prices are ranging from €3.50/kg to €4.00/kg depending on grade with young bulls grading R/U making €4.20/kg to €4.40/kg.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said there is no justification for prices lagging behind the Prime Export Benchmark Price by 17c/kg and factories must start returning the full value of the current market in beef prices offered to farmers.</p>
<p>“Cracks are appearing in the stranglehold factories have had on prices over the past few weeks.  Farmers should sell hard in what is a very strong market for beef, with supplies not meeting the lucrative Christmas demand,” he said.</p>

<p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> International Meeting of the EU funded H2020 network project BovINE is hosted by Estonian partner Liivimaa Lihaveis. The meeting brings together beef farmers, advisors, veterinarians, producers, suppliers, researchers, and policy players to share knowledge and exchange ideas to establish the sustainability of the European beef sector.</p>
<p>“On behalf of Liivimaa, Estonia is delighted to host this BovINE meeting at such a critical point in the sector’s history,” says Estonian Network Manager, Airi Külvet. “BovINE’s network across 10 countries enables access to existing and developing knowledge to improve not only animal health and welfare, but also environmental sustainability and socioeconomic resilience of the beef farming community including production efficiency. In addition, knowledge shared on consumer needs and expectations of meat quality for example will help us plan for the future.”</p>
<p>BovINE’s Irish Network Manager Kevin Kinsella said, “Everybody is welcome. All beef farmers and stakeholders are invited to register and attend online the very interesting sessions organised by our Estonian partners”.  </p>
<p>Estonia’s Minister for Rural Affairs, <a>Mr. Urmas Kruuse</a>, will open the meeting with a keynote speech on Estonia’s perspective on sustainability and beef, followed by a series of sessions presented by BovINE’s Network Managers and Thematic Working Group leaders.</p>
<p>“Many solutions to the challenges facing the beef sector already exist,” says BovINE project co-ordinator, Prof Maeve Henchion of Teagasc. “Some are solutions farmers have come up with themselves and are already implementing on-farm, others have been developed by researchers and are ready to move from research into practice. BovINE has collected solutions to specific topics across all dimensions of sustainability from these sources in 2021. We look forward to discussing them with farmers, advisors, researchers and all representatives of the beef value chain at our forthcoming meeting.”</p>
<p>Outcomes from demonstrations and discussions held over the past year with and between farmers will highlight Good Practices already in use and Research Innovations identified across the project’s four thematic areas: Environmental Sustainability, Socioeconomic Resilience, Animal Health &amp; Welfare, and Production Efficiency and Meat Quality.</p>

<p>Commenting on the Minister for Agriculture’s announcement today of his intention to establish a new stakeholder forum for suckler and beef farmers, IFA President Tim Cullinan said the new body must be equipped with powers to have a meaningful impact on the income of livestock farmers.</p>

<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have moved on by 5c-10c/kg this week, but are still lagging behind the returns from our key export markets where prices continue their strong growth.</p>
<p>This is reflected in the latest Prime Export Benchmark price of €4.24/kg, which is now 13c/kg above our Prime Composite price.</p>

<p>“Supplies of suitable cattle are extremely tight here and in the UK.  Farmers should dig in and sell hard to push factories into paying the prices justified in the market place,” he said.</p>

<h2>Beef</h2>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have started to move upwards as factories struggle to secure supplies. He said most farmers are now securing €4.20/kg for steers, with prices up to €4.30/kg offered for specialist lots.  Most heifers are now moving at €4.25/kg, with up to €4.35/kg offered at the top end. He said prices in the UK have strengthened again and supplies are running 4% below 2020 levels, creating strong demand for Irish beef for the lucrative Christmas trade. The IFA Livestock Chairman said our beef prices are lagging 9c/kg behind the latest Prime Export Benchmark price and must push on. “Factories need cattle to fill the lucrative Christmas orders and must return the full value of the current strong market conditions,” he said.</p>

<h2>Sheep</h2>
<p>IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said the lamb trade continues to strengthen, driven by strong market demand and tight supplies of finished lamb. Factories are paying €7.30/kg to €7.50/kg with higher deals available for groups and larger lots. In addition, transport and weights to 22.5kg and 23kg are on the table to close out deals he said. Strong factory demand is feeding through to mart sales where factory agents, wholesalers and store buyers are competing very strongly for the limited number of lambs available. He said store lambs making from €3.10/kg to €3.50/kg in marts, with hill type lambs coming into €3.00/kg to €3.20/kg. Sean Dennehy said returns from mart sales are comparable to and in some cases above prices factories are offering, providing farmers a real alternative market for their lambs.</p>

<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have started to move upwards as factories struggle to secure supplies.</p>
<p>He said most farmers are now securing €4.20/kg for steers, with prices up to €4.30/kg offered for specialist lots.  Most heifers are now moving at €4.25/kg, with up to €4.35/kg offered at the top end. Cull cows have steadied and are ranging from €3.50/kg to €4.00/kg depending on grade.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said prices in the UK have strengthened again and supplies are running 4% below 2020 levels, creating strong demand for Irish beef for the lucrative Christmas trade.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said our beef prices are lagging 9c/kg behind the latest Prime Export Benchmark price and must push on.</p>
<p>“Cattle supplies are predicted to be extremely tight up to year end.  Combined with the reduced volumes of beef in the UK and the low levels of South American imports in the EU market, this creates a very positive market environment for Irish beef which must be returned to farmers in strong price increases,” he said.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said farmers should dig in and sell hard.  “Factories need cattle to fill the lucrative Christmas orders and must return the full value of the current strong market conditions,” he said.</p>

<h2>Beef Update</h2>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said farmers should dig in and sell hard as supplies of prime cattle are well short of market demand, the base prices offered of €4.20/kg for steers and €4.25/kg for heifers to most farmers are lagging behind what the market is returning and must push on. </p>
<p>Brendan Golden said favourable and strengthening market conditions should be coming through in higher beef prices. He said Teagasc has clearly shown the target for beef prices must be over €5.00/kg to cover the continuous increase in production costs.  Factories must stand firm with the large retailers to ensure beef prices keep pace with the production cost increases farmers have to endure.</p>

<h2>Sheep Update</h2>
<p>IFA Sheep Committee Chairman Sean Dennehy said market demand for lambs has pushed prices on 40c/kg in the past week. He said at this stage factories are offering €7.40/kg, with deals on weights to 22.5/kgs, and in some cases, 23kgs. Transport is also on offer to secure lambs. Sean Dennehy said higher deals are available for groups and larger lots and the trade will continue to strengthen as supplies fall well short of market demand. Some factories are also offering bonuses of 20c/kg for light lambs up to 15/kgs, in an attempt to increase throughput of lambs. He said competition in marts is intense between butchers, wholesalers, factory agents and store finishers.  This is providing farmers with a real competitive alternative to factories and ensuring the supply demand balance remains firmly in farmers’ favour.</p>

Beef Update
The IFA Livestock Chairman said farmers should dig in and sell hard as supplies of prime cattle are well short of market demand, the base prices offered of €4.20/kg for steers and €4.25/kg for heifers to most farmers are lagging behind what the market is returning and must push on. 
Brendan Golden said favourable and strengthening market conditions should be coming through in higher beef prices. He said Teagasc has clearly shown the target for beef prices must be over €5.00/kg to cover the continuous increase in production costs.  Factories must stand firm with the large retailers to ensure beef prices keep pace with the production cost increases farmers have to endure.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Committee Chairman Sean Dennehy said market demand for lambs has pushed prices on 40c/kg in the past week. He said at this stage factories are offering €7.40/kg, with deals on weights to 22.5/kgs, and in some cases, 23kgs. Transport is also on offer to secure lambs. Sean Dennehy said higher deals are available for groups and larger lots and the trade will continue to strengthen as supplies fall well short of market demand. Some factories are also offering bonuses of 20c/kg for light lambs up to 15/kgs, in an attempt to increase throughput of lambs. He said competition in marts is intense between butchers, wholesalers, factory agents and store finishers.  This is providing farmers with a real competitive alternative to factories and ensuring the supply demand balance remains firmly in farmers’ favour.

<h2>Beef Update</h2>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices must move on to keep pace with the significant increases in the UK and EU cattle prices. He said the latest Prime Export Benchmark price is €4.19/kg, which is 9c/kg above the prime Irish composite price of €4.10/kg. “Beef prices in our key markets have strengthened consistently over the past number of weeks, up 10c/kg, against a background of static Irish prices,” he said. He said demand for beef is strong and will increase over the coming weeks as factories start buying for the lucrative Christmas trade as supplies tighten on the ground.  UK supplies are predicted to be 5% below last year’s levels over this period. Based on throughput to-date, Bord Bia predict there will be over 40,000 fewer cattle to slaughter between now and year end.</p>

<h2>Sheep Update</h2>
<p>IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said lamb price continues to rise as factories struggle to match supplies with market demand, increasing by 30c/kg over the week. He said lambs are making €6.70/kg to €6.80/kg today, with weights of 22.5kgs and 23kgs offered. Cull ewes are making €3.00/kg to €3.30/kg in general. He said some lambs bought by factories are coming in at the equivalent of €6.90/kg, with farmers sights now on the €7.00/kg target. “Good quality fleshed lambs are very scarce on the ground and factories are having to compete to secure supplies to meet the strong market demand for sheep meat,” he said. The mart trade has also strengthened for all types of sheep with competition between factory agents, wholesalers and butchers with factory agents also competing for short keep stores to secure numbers.</p>

Beef Update
IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices must move on to keep pace with the significant increases in the UK and EU cattle prices. He said the latest Prime Export Benchmark price is €4.19/kg, which is 9c/kg above the prime Irish composite price of €4.10/kg. “Beef prices in our key markets have strengthened consistently over the past number of weeks, up 10c/kg, against a background of static Irish prices,” he said. He said demand for beef is strong and will increase over the coming weeks as factories start buying for the lucrative Christmas trade as supplies tighten on the ground.  UK supplies are predicted to be 5% below last year’s levels over this period. Based on throughput to-date, Bord Bia predict there will be over 40,000 fewer cattle to slaughter between now and year end.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said lamb price continues to rise as factories struggle to match supplies with market demand, increasing by 30c/kg over the week. He said lambs are making €6.70/kg to €6.80/kg today, with weights of 22.5kgs and 23kgs offered. Cull ewes are making €3.00/kg to €3.30/kg in general. He said some lambs bought by factories are coming in at the equivalent of €6.90/kg, with farmers sights now on the €7.00/kg target. “Good quality fleshed lambs are very scarce on the ground and factories are having to compete to secure supplies to meet the strong market demand for sheep meat,” he said. The mart trade has also strengthened for all types of sheep with competition between factory agents, wholesalers and butchers with factory agents also competing for short keep stores to secure numbers.
Lamb Price Update 04/11/21
Lamb €6.80/6.95kg. Deals on weights to 22.5/23kg. Strong demand sell hard. Ewes €3.00/3.30kg.

<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue has to honour the commitment he has made at mart meetings that he will pay out on every suckler cow that’s applied for in the next CAP.</p>
<p>“IFA set out clear demands for a €300 suckler cow payment and €100/animal payment for cattle rearing and finishing farmers to ensure CAP monies directly support Irish beef farmers for producing beef to the highest welfare and environmental standards in the world.”</p>
<p>“The Minister confirmed in Thurles on Friday, and again yesterday in Granard, that every suckler cow would be approved for funding at the levels announced. What has been allocated so far for Pillar II will not meet that commitment, so the Minister has to find the extra funding needed,” he said.</p>
<p>He said the Minister has the opportunity to directly support these farmers with meaningful, targeted suckler cow and cattle rearing and finishing schemes.</p>

IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue has to honour the commitment he has made at mart meetings that he will pay out on every suckler cow that’s applied for in the next CAP.
“IFA set out clear demands for a €300 suckler cow payment and €100/animal payment for cattle rearing and finishing farmers to ensure CAP monies directly support Irish beef farmers for producing beef to the highest welfare and environmental standards in the world.”
“The Minister confirmed in Thurles on Friday, and again yesterday in Granard, that every suckler cow would be approved for funding at the levels announced. What has been allocated so far for Pillar II will not meet that commitment, so the Minister has to find the extra funding needed,” he said.
He said the Minister has the opportunity to directly support these farmers with meaningful, targeted suckler cow and cattle rearing and finishing schemes.

<h2>Beef Update</h2>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the new CAP funding and strategic plans are a sell-out of suckler and beef farmers by Minister Charlie McConalogue. He said, “The design of the strategic plans and the funding levels allocated to Pillar II targeted schemes compound the impact of convergence, CRISS and eco-schemes on the suckler and beef farmers most dependant on direct payments for their family income”. “IFA set out clear demands for a €300 suckler cow payment and €100/animal payment for cattle rearing and finishing farmers to ensure CAP monies directly support Irish beef farmers for producing beef to the highest welfare and environmental standards in the world. The Minister has ignored these proposals.” He said the proposed new suckler cow scheme has left 500,000 cows and 30,000 suckler farmers behind based on the funding allocation and number of participants announced this week.</p>

<h2>Sheep Update</h2>
<p>IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue’s CAP Strategic Plan will exclude one million ewes from any funding. “The proposed €20m/annum Sheep Improvement Scheme with payments of €12/ewe will only be available to 1.7m ewes. This is even fewer than the number of ewes in the current Sheep Welfare Scheme,” he said. He made this point directly to Minister McConalogue at the IFA protest in Kilkenny on Thursday night and called on the Minister to provide funding for €30 for all ewes in the country in the new CAP plans. “According to the most recent census figures, there are over 2.6m ewes in the country.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/suckler-farmers-sold-out-in-cap-plan/,Suckler Farmers Sold Out in CAP Plan,22 October 2021,"<div class=""single-content"">
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote is-style-default""><p>500,000 cows and over 30,000 suckler farmers left behind in New Suckler Scheme proposals</p><p>No proposals to support cattle rearing and finishing farmers</p></blockquote>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the new CAP funding and strategic plans are a sell-out of suckler and beef farmers by the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue.</p>
<p>He made this point directly to the Minister at last night’s IFA protest in Tullow.</p>
<p>He said, “The design of the strategic plans and the funding levels allocated to Pillar II targeted schemes compound the impact of convergence, CRISS and eco-schemes on the suckler and beef farmers most dependant on direct payments for their family income”.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said suckler and beef farmers depend on direct payments for 160% of farm family income.</p>
<p>“These plans are cutting this income by up to 50% through a combination of flattening in convergence, CRISS and eco-schemes. The impact of these measures is further compounded by additional compliance costs and reduced efficiencies, all taking from the pockets of the most economically vulnerable farmers.”</p>
<p>He said the Minister had the opportunity to directly support these farmers with meaningful, targeted suckler cow and cattle rearing and finishing schemes but has failed to do so.</p>
<p>“IFA set out clear demands for a €300 suckler cow payment and €100/animal payment for cattle rearing and finishing farmers to ensure CAP monies directly support Irish beef farmers for producing beef to the highest welfare and environmental standards in the world. The Minister has ignored these proposals.”</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said the proposed new suckler cow scheme has left 500,000 cows and 30,000 suckler farmers behind based on the funding allocation and number of participants announced this week by the Minister.  This scheme must be extended to provide €300 for every suckler cow in the country that participates in the scheme.</p>

500,000 cows and over 30,000 suckler farmers left behind in New Suckler Scheme proposalsNo proposals to support cattle rearing and finishing farmers
IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the new CAP funding and strategic plans are a sell-out of suckler and beef farmers by the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue.
He made this point directly to the Minister at last night’s IFA protest in Tullow.
He said, “The design of the strategic plans and the funding levels allocated to Pillar II targeted schemes compound the impact of convergence, CRISS and eco-schemes on the suckler and beef farmers most dependant on direct payments for their family income”.
Brendan Golden said suckler and beef farmers depend on direct payments for 160% of farm family income.
“These plans are cutting this income by up to 50% through a combination of flattening in convergence, CRISS and eco-schemes. The impact of these measures is further compounded by additional compliance costs and reduced efficiencies, all taking from the pockets of the most economically vulnerable farmers.”
He said the Minister had the opportunity to directly support these farmers with meaningful, targeted suckler cow and cattle rearing and finishing schemes but has failed to do so.
“IFA set out clear demands for a €300 suckler cow payment and €100/animal payment for cattle rearing and finishing farmers to ensure CAP monies directly support Irish beef farmers for producing beef to the highest welfare and environmental standards in the world. The Minister has ignored these proposals.”
Brendan Golden said the proposed new suckler cow scheme has left 500,000 cows and 30,000 suckler farmers behind based on the funding allocation and number of participants announced this week by the Minister.  This scheme must be extended to provide €300 for every suckler cow in the country that participates in the scheme.

<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said favourable and strengthening market conditions should be coming through in higher beef prices.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said supplies of finished cattle are tight and factories are actively offering various deals to secure numbers while trying to hold back on base price increases.</p>
<p>“The current base prices for steers and heifers of €4.20/kg and €4.25/kg, respectively, are lagging behind market returns and must move on,” he said.</p>
<p>Demand for cull cows is steady, with the P grades still commanding €3.60/kg in some factories and better grading R and U grade cows making up to €4.00/kg</p>
<p>The kill to-date this year is 70,000 down on last year, which means there will be 40,000 fewer cattle available to factories between now and Christmas based on the Bord Bia supply predictions for the year.</p>
<p>UK beef production is currently 4% below last year’s levels, a trend that is forecast to continue for the remainder of the year.  This in turn increases demand for Irish beef in this key market over the coming months.</p>
<p>EU prices have risen by 10c/kg over the past two weeks.  When combined with the strong steady beef prices in the UK, this has now pushed the Prime Export Benchmark price 5c/kg above the prime Irish composite price to €4.16/kg, compared to the Irish price of €4.11/kg.</p>
<p>“These strengthening market conditions must be reflected in price increases from factories. With supplies not matching demand, farmers should sell hard to push prices on,” he said.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said exports to Northern Ireland have experienced a strong increase since the beginning of the year, reaching almost 60,000 head to-date. This is almost 30% higher than the same period in 2020 with this demand expected to continue for the rest of the year offering vital competition for forward store and finished cattle.</p>
<p>He said overall there were 218,360 cattle exported to date this year which represents only a small decline from the 222,456 cattle exported in the same period in 2020.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said the positive market conditions created by the reduced volumes of South American beef imports in our key markets must be maximised and returned to farmers in higher beef prices.</p>
<p>He said Teagasc has clearly shown the target for beef prices must be €5.00/kg to cover the continuous increase in production costs.  Factories must stand firm with the large retailers to ensure beef prices keep pace with the production cost increases farmers have to endure.</p>

<h3>Beef Update</h3>
<p>IFA livestock chairman Brendan said the roll over of the suckler cow schemes, BDGP and BEEPs, is welcome in Budget 2022. </p>
<p>However, the IFA livestock chairman said it is disappointing a pilot cattle rearing and finishing scheme was not provided for 2022 to build towards the provision of a scheme for all cattle rearers and finishers in the new CAP. Brendan said the critical issue now for the 2022 suckler cow schemes is ease of access for farmers to these schemes and the facilitation of farmers who had issues with the schemes in the past for the coming year.</p>

<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>IFA sheep committee chairman Sean Dennehy said demand from factories is very strong for lamb this week with prices moving up by over 10c/kg. He said most lambs are now moving at prices of €6.35 to €6.45/kg with €6.50/kg and higher paid for larger lots of suitable lambs. Weights of 23kgs are being talked about and some deals are starting to be done at these levels. Cull ewe demand is not as strong in the factories this week. Sean Dennehy said farmers should continue to move lambs as they become fit while selling hard in a positive and strengthening market for sheep meat.</p>

Beef Update
IFA livestock chairman Brendan said the roll over of the suckler cow schemes, BDGP and BEEPs, is welcome in Budget 2022. 
However, the IFA livestock chairman said it is disappointing a pilot cattle rearing and finishing scheme was not provided for 2022 to build towards the provision of a scheme for all cattle rearers and finishers in the new CAP. Brendan said the critical issue now for the 2022 suckler cow schemes is ease of access for farmers to these schemes and the facilitation of farmers who had issues with the schemes in the past for the coming year.

<h3>Beef Update</h3>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have remained strong this week. A base price of €4.20 to €4.30/kg is available for steers and heifers are achieving €4.25 to €4.35/kg with higher prices available for larger lots. The IFA Livestock chairman said it is important that cattle are marketed as they become fit. “Farmers are reminded that if cattle aren’t fit for slaughter, the mart is a real viable option” he said. Factory agents remain very active around mart rings looking for cattle that require a short finish for their own feedlots. “All the market indicators are good, with both retail and food service demand up on 2019 levels” he said. </p>

<h3><strong>Sheep Update</strong></h3>
<p>IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said tight supply is driving on the lamb trade. “Factory agents have had   difficulty sourcing fit lamb this week which has pushed prices on” he said. €6.25 to €6.40/kg to 22kg is freely available for factory fit lamb. As always, better deals are available for groups and larger lots.</p>
<p>Where farmers are struggling to achieve high prices for lamb, they are reminded that the mart trade is also very strong and an option worth considering. The IFA Sheep Chairman said farmers should move lambs as they become fit, but to sell hard to maximise returns. Ewes are making €3.00 to €3.30kg.</p>

Beef Update
IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have remained strong this week. A base price of €4.20 to €4.30/kg is available for steers and heifers are achieving €4.25 to €4.35/kg with higher prices available for larger lots. The IFA Livestock chairman said it is important that cattle are marketed as they become fit. “Farmers are reminded that if cattle aren’t fit for slaughter, the mart is a real viable option” he said. Factory agents remain very active around mart rings looking for cattle that require a short finish for their own feedlots. “All the market indicators are good, with both retail and food service demand up on 2019 levels” he said.

<h3>Beef Update</h3>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have remained steady this week as a result of strong farmer resistance to lower quotes. He said factories are paying €4.20-€4.30/kg base price to get steers this week, with up to €4.35/kg available for heifers. Supplies of cattle for the remainder of the year are predicted by Bord Bia to be back up to 40,000 head compared to last year.  Brendan Golden said factories know supplies will be extremely tight for the year. Demand for Irish beef will be strong and prices must reflect this favourable market situation. Young bulls are ranging from €4.15 to €4.30Kg for R and U grades and cows are making €3.60 to €4.00/kg.</p>

<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said demand for lamb is strong from factories this week. He said market conditions remain strong and the number of suitable lambs available are tight. Last week’s sheep throughput was back 3,012 head from the previous week and overall throughput is running 103,055 head behind the corresponding date in 2020. Factories are paying €6.20kg to €6.35/kg, with higher deals available for groups and larger lots. Weights to 22kg are also available to farmers in factories. Mart trade is performing very strong with finished and store lambs in high demand.  Cull ewes are making from €3.00kg to €3.30kg. He said farmers should sell hard in this positive market environment, while moving lambs as they become fit to maximize returns.</p>

Beef Update
IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have remained steady this week as a result of strong farmer resistance to lower quotes. He said factories are paying €4.20-€4.30/kg base price to get steers this week, with up to €4.35/kg available for heifers. Supplies of cattle for the remainder of the year are predicted by Bord Bia to be back up to 40,000 head compared to last year.  Brendan Golden said factories know supplies will be extremely tight for the year. Demand for Irish beef will be strong and prices must reflect this favourable market situation. Young bulls are ranging from €4.15 to €4.30Kg for R and U grades and cows are making €3.60 to €4.00/kg.

<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said supplies of lambs are extremely tight this week, swinging control back in farmers’ favour. He said factories are struggling to secure lambs.  Agents are very active in mart sales in attempts to secure supplies. Sean Dennehy said factories are freely paying €6.30/kg to 21.5kgs, with higher deals on price and weights offered to close out deals. “Farmers should sell hard in very strong market conditions to maintain control of the trade,” he said. He said farmers should only sell lambs to factories as they become fit.  The very strong store trade is ensuring alternatives for lighter and under finished lambs and it’s keeping the supply-demand balance in favour of farmers. Sean Dennehy said based on all projections, there won’t be an oversupply of lamb for the year and orderly marketing is critical to maximise returns.</p>

<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden has strongly criticised the comments attributed to the outgoing Teagasc Director Gerry Boyle about the future of the suckler sector.</p>
<p>“It’s appalling that a senior industry figure would show such disregard for a farm sector that is unique in the scale of its significance in every county,” he said.</p>
<p>“100,000 farmers are involved in beef production. To dismiss them in such a cavalier fashion shows very poor judgement,” he said.</p>
<p>Farmers will be very surprised to see Gerry Boyle say that Teagasc was ‘strongly advocating’ switching from beef production to dairy beef production. “We need Teagasc to clarify their position urgently,” he said.</p>
<p>“Of all people, Gerry Boyle should know the value of the beef suckler sector to the rural economy. As an economist, he should also know the wider benefits of the livestock sector in towns and villages across the country,” he said.</p>
<p>What farmers expect to hear from Teagasc is some support for our suckler herd, which contributes to beef exports of €2bn.</p>
<p>Our export markets value the quality beef that we produce.  The exports will only continue if we implement policies to bring beef farmers towards viability.</p>
<p>Our pre-Budget submission has a target of €300 per suckler cow. If the Govt is serious about maintaining the beef sector, then it has to provide funding for beef farmers.</p>

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said the decision by the Brazilian authorities to stop exports to China presents a huge opportunity for our beef sector.</p>
<p>“The Taoiseach Micheál Martin, the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue and the Govt must now redouble their efforts to secure an immediate return of Irish beef to the Chinese market,” he said.</p>
<p>“We should be making the most of this decision by Brazil. It’s a chance to gain a foothold in a market where demand is growing for quality food,” he said.</p>
<p>Brazil exported nearly 400,000 tonnes of beef to China in the first six months of this year, underlining the scale of the market that exists there.</p>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the Chinese market for Irish beef for the first six months of 2020 had grown in value by over 60% to €22.5m, compared to the previous year.  This is a clear indication of the strength of demand and potential for Irish beef exports.</p>
<p>“There’s huge demand for beef in China.  It’s critical that Irish farmers who produce to the most exacting standards in the world are in a position to avail of this,” he said.</p>
<p>The Livestock Chairman said the Government cannot let the opportunity pass and must immediately secure the return of access for Irish beef to this strong and growing market.</p>

<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said tight supplies and strong farmer resistance have maintained beef prices this week, with some factories forced into increasing quotes to secure numbers.</p>

<p>The IFA Livestock Committee has strongly criticised the proposals put forward for suckler and beef farmers in the Department of Agriculture’s CAP consultation document.</p>
<p>Speaking after the meeting, IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said members are very disappointed at the lack of ambition to provide meaningful support to the sector, and at the underhanded attempts to limit the national suckler herd through the proposed suckler cow scheme.</p>
<p>The Committee, which met on Friday, consists of democratically-elected representatives of suckler and beef farmers from every county in the country.</p>
<p>Setting out the conclusions of the Committee, Brendan Golden said any attempt to limit or cap the national suckler herd has been rejected out of hand and will not be accepted by IFA.</p>
<p>He said Irish suckler farmers operate one of the most environmentally sustainable beef farming systems in the world and are a critical component of beef production, within the higher environmental standards that are being imposed on farming and food production by the EU in the new CAP.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said suckler farmers must be directly supported in the Strategic Plans for what they do.  These must include a payment of €300/cow with no underhand attempts within the scheme to limit or cap the national herd.</p>
<p>The Livestock Committee also strongly rejected the compulsion to be part of the Bord Bia Quality Assurance Scheme (QA) as a condition of eligibility to receive payments. QA is recognised as a market requirement and as such farmers who participate must be rewarded from the market place</p>
<p>“It’s not acceptable or appropriate to impose this requirement as a condition of the suckler scheme.  Farmers are already measuring carbon in existing schemes without the requirement to be part of the Bord Bia QA Scheme,” he said.</p>
<p>The IFA Chairman was also very critical of the Department’s failure to include a cattle rearing and finishing scheme in the Strategic Plans. IFA has made proposals to the Department of Agriculture to extend the Pilot Dairy Calf to beef scheme to include meaningful payments to farmers who rear and finish weanlings and stores from suckler farms.  These farmers must be provided with a scheme that returns at least €100 an animal.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said productive suckler and beef farmers are those that are most dependent on strong direct supports, which account for up to 160% of FFI on these farms.  They are also the farmers who are impacted most by the convergence and Eco Scheme proposals within Pillar I.</p>
<p>“Eco Schemes must be designed to ensure every farmer, at a minimum, is provided with the opportunity to claim back all the monies that is taken from their individual entitlement value,” he said.</p>
<p>There is ample opportunity within Pillar II to offset this impact and reward Irish suckler and beef farmers directly for the food we produce to the standards imposed on us by the EU. The key question is there a willingness from our Minister for Agriculture to formulate Strategic Plans and provide the co-financing allowed in Pillar II to achieve these objectives.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said while the requirements for the new CAP are challenging, there is nothing stopping the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue in the National Strategic Plans from ensuring supports are directed in a targeted manner to suckler and beef farmers that reflect the standards and quality of production on these farms and the contribution to the environmental objectives in these production systems.</p>
<p>He said the current proposals for livestock farmers in the Pillar II schemes must be fundamentally changed.  IFA will be putting forward a detailed response to the consultation process and raising these issues directly with the Minister for Agriculture.</p>

<h3><strong>Beef Update</strong> </h3>
<p>Brendan Golden said farmers should ignore the negative propaganda from factories and their agents who are intent on trying to undermine the market. Supplies of cattle for the remainder of the year are predicted by Bord Bia to be back up to 40,000 head compared to last year. In our main market – the UK – supplies are running below last year’s levels by 5%. This is forecast to continue for the year. He said GB prices have strengthened consistently since mid-May with EU Young Bull prices also edging upwards, highlighting the demand for beef in our main markets. The IFA Livestock Chairman said the latest Prime Irish Composite price is €4.23/kg, compared to the EU Prime Export Benchmark price of €4.06/kg, with the Export Benchmark Price increasing by 3c/kg on the week.</p>

<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said lamb prices have increased by up to 20c/kg this week as factories compete for supplies. He said prices of €6.40/kg are available, with deals to 21.5kgs. Better deals are available for larger lots and groups. Cull ewes are making €3.40 to €3.60/kg. He said store and breeding sales are buoyant in the marts and they’re providing competition for lamb supplies to the factories. He said farmers should sell hard in a strong market, while moving lambs as they become fit. “The orderly selling of lambs this year is ensuring there will be no glut of lambs coming onto the market. The absence of imports from outside the EU in the market place is also a significant contributor to the positive market conditions which should prevail for the year,” he said.</p>

Beef Update 
Brendan Golden said farmers should ignore the negative propaganda from factories and their agents who are intent on trying to undermine the market. Supplies of cattle for the remainder of the year are predicted by Bord Bia to be back up to 40,000 head compared to last year. In our main market – the UK – supplies are running below last year’s levels by 5%. This is forecast to continue for the year. He said GB prices have strengthened consistently since mid-May with EU Young Bull prices also edging upwards, highlighting the demand for beef in our main markets. The IFA Livestock Chairman said the latest Prime Irish Composite price is €4.23/kg, compared to the EU Prime Export Benchmark price of €4.06/kg, with the Export Benchmark Price increasing by 3c/kg on the week.

<p>In our main market – the UK – supplies are running below last year’s levels by 5%. This is forecast to continue for the year.</p>
<p>He said GB prices have strengthened consistently since mid-May with EU Young Bull prices also edging upwards, highlighting the demand for beef in our main markets.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said the latest Prime Irish Composite price is €4.23/kg, compared to the EU Prime Export Benchmark price of €4.06/kg, with the Export Benchmark Price increasing by 3c/kg on the week.</p>
<p>“Factories know supplies will be extremely tight for the year. Demand for Irish beef will be strong and prices must reflect this favourable market situation,” he said.</p>
<p>He said despite lower quotes in some factories, steers are making €4.20/kg with heifers making up to €4.25/kg base prices. Demand for Young Bulls is steady with prices ranging from €4.10 to €4.30/kg for R and U grades. Cow prices are steady.

<p>“Grass supplies are good, cattle are performing well and cattle should only be moved as they become fit to ensure farmers keep control of the supply/demand balance,” he said.</p>

<h3>Beef Update</h3>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said that Minister McConalogue must clarify his intentions on the draft suckler scheme for 2023-2027, which is now out for public consultation as part of the new CAP Strategic Plan. “While farmers will understand the concept of a reference year, any suggestion that farmers would suffer a penalty on their payments for existing cows if they increase numbers would be unprecedented and unacceptable,” he said. “IFA has consistently sought a payment of €300 per suckler cow. This scheme must be the vehicle to do that, but we can’t have restrictive conditions. The Minister and the Department need to learn the lessons from the BEAM scheme, which turned what should have been a good news story into a negative,” he said.</p>

<h3>Beef Update</h3>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said market conditions for beef should be favourable for the remainder of the year as markets and buying patterns return to normal. He said supplies of finished cattle would be tight for the rest of the year. Numbers are back to date by over 67,000 head, with the annual kill predicted to be back a further 50,000 head by year-end, with a total of 110 – 120,000 fewer slaughter cattle available than 2020. “The strong performance of the live export trade to Northern Ireland for store and finished cattle, which is expected to continue into the back end of the year, is adding strong competition for farmers and ensuring numbers of finished cattle will be tight up to year-end. Forty-two thousand six hundred and fifty-five cattle have been exported to NI this year, increasing from 13,896 in 2020,” he said.</p>

<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>IFA National Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy says the outlook for lamb prices is positive. He said significant numbers of lambs were moved in the past few weeks to meet demand for the Eid festival. He said, “Farmers have moved lambs at lighter weights this year with average carcase weights back .5kg for the year. This has reduced the volume of sheep meat in the marketplace, a situation replicated in the UK and ensures there won’t be a glut of lambs to come out”. Breeding sales will be starting, and combined with the strong store trade, will provide competition to factories for lambs. He said farmers should sell hard as lambs become fit throughout the remainder of the year in a favourable market environment.</p>

<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said that Minister McConalogue must clarify his intentions on the draft suckler scheme for 2023-2027, which is now out for public consultation as part of the new CAP Strategic Plan.<br/><br/>“While farmers will understand the concept of a reference year, any suggestion that farmers would suffer a penalty on their payments for existing cows if they increase numbers would be unprecedented and unacceptable,” he said.<br/><br/>“IFA has consistently sought a payment of €300 per suckler cow. This scheme must be the vehicle to do that, but we can’t have restrictive conditions.

IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said that Minister McConalogue must clarify his intentions on the draft suckler scheme for 2023-2027, which is now out for public consultation as part of the new CAP Strategic Plan.“While farmers will understand the concept of a reference year, any suggestion that farmers would suffer a penalty on their payments for existing cows if they increase numbers would be unprecedented and unacceptable,” he said.“IFA has consistently sought a payment of €300 per suckler cow. This scheme must be the vehicle to do that, but we can’t have restrictive conditions. The Minister and the Department need to learn the lessons from the BEAM scheme, which turned what should have been a good news story into a negative,” he said.“The overall problem with the consultation document is that there is no indication of the budget for the schemes.

<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>IFA Sheep committee chairman Sean Dennehy said the outlook for lamb prices is positive. He said significant numbers of lambs were moved in the past few weeks to meet demand for the Eid festival. In addition, he said farmers have moved lambs at lighter weights this year with average carcase weights back .5kg for the year. This has reduced the volume of sheep meat in the market place, a situation replicated in the UK and ensures there will not be a glut of lambs to come out. Breeding sales will be starting and combined with the strong store trade will provide competition to factories for lambs. Farmers should sell hard and continue to move lambs as they become fit to maximise returns.</p>

Beef Update
IFA Livestock chairman Brendan Golden said market conditions for beef should be favourable for the remainder of the year as markets and buying patterns start to return to more normal activity. Supplies of finished cattle will be tight for the rest of the year with numbers back to-date by over 67,000 head with the annual kill predicted to be back a further 50,000 head by year end to a total of 110 – 120,000 less slaughter cattle available than 2020. Strong performance of the live export trade to Northern Ireland for store and finished cattle, which is expected to continue into the back end, is adding vital competition for farmers and ensuring numbers of finished cattle will be tight up to year end. 42,655 cattle have been exported to NI this year already which is an increase of 13,896 on 2020.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep committee chairman Sean Dennehy said the outlook for lamb prices is positive. He said significant numbers of lambs were moved in the past few weeks to meet demand for the Eid festival. In addition, he said farmers have moved lambs at lighter weights this year with average carcase weights back .5kg for the year. This has reduced the volume of sheep meat in the market place, a situation replicated in the UK and ensures there will not be a glut of lambs to come out. Breeding sales will be starting and combined with the strong store trade will provide competition to factories for lambs. Farmers should sell hard and continue to move lambs as they become fit to maximise returns.

<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>IFA Sheep committee chairman Sean Dennehy said prices are steady following the increased market demand during Eid al-Adha festival which concludes today. Demand for factory fit lambs will remain strong as supplies will be limited following the earlier selling of lighter lambs in the past few weeks. Factories are paying €6.30 to €6.40/kg for lambs. The reopening of indoor dining will also contribute to driving the trade on. Store sales and the commencement of breeding sales over the coming weeks will add further competition to the trade. Ewes are in good demand in both the factory and the mart, factory prices are ranging from €3.30 to €3.60/kg. </p>

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep committee chairman Sean Dennehy said prices are steady following the increased market demand during Eid al-Adha festival which concludes today. Demand for factory fit lambs will remain strong as supplies will be limited following the earlier selling of lighter lambs in the past few weeks. Factories are paying €6.30 to €6.40/kg for lambs. The reopening of indoor dining will also contribute to driving the trade on. Store sales and the commencement of breeding sales over the coming weeks will add further competition to the trade. Ewes are in good demand in both the factory and the mart, factory prices are ranging from €3.30 to €3.60/kg.

<h2>Beef Update</h2>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said market conditions for beef remain strong. He said the trade is underpinned by tight supplies and strong retail performance. Steers are making €4.25-4.35/kg, heifers are making €4.30/4.40/kg, with some deals higher, including flat prices for selective lots. He said the prime Irish composite price continues to edge upwards with last week’s price increasing to €4.16/kg and the prime export benchmark price increasing to €4.06/kg. The IFA Chairman said supplies of suitable cattle are tight and demand from factory agents in marts for all types of finished cattle is strong. Cows are ranging from €3.60-4.00/kg Young Bulls R/U €4.30-4.40/kg. Brendan Golden said farmers should sell hard as factories struggle to meet demand.</p>

<h2>Sheep Update</h2>
<p>IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said strong market demand and tight supplies of suitable lambs forced factories into increasing prices this week. “Deals of €6.40 to €6.60/kg are being offered. Farmers with suitable lambs are rightly holding out for these and higher prices,” he said. Factories are actively seeking lambs to meet the increased demand for the Eid festival starting on July 20th and have had to increase prices. The trade is helped by increased live export buying and will be further supported following the Eid festival as breeding and store sales commence.

Beef Update
IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said market conditions for beef remain strong. He said the trade is underpinned by tight supplies and strong retail performance. Steers are making €4.25-4.35/kg, heifers are making €4.30/4.40/kg, with some deals higher, including flat prices for selective lots. He said the prime Irish composite price continues to edge upwards with last week’s price increasing to €4.16/kg and the prime export benchmark price increasing to €4.06/kg. The IFA Chairman said supplies of suitable cattle are tight and demand from factory agents in marts for all types of finished cattle is strong. Cows are ranging from €3.60-4.00/kg Young Bulls R/U €4.30-4.40/kg. Brendan Golden said farmers should sell hard as factories struggle to meet demand.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said strong market demand and tight supplies of suitable lambs forced factories into increasing prices this week. “Deals of €6.40 to €6.60/kg are being offered. Farmers with suitable lambs are rightly holding out for these and higher prices,” he said. Factories are actively seeking lambs to meet the increased demand for the Eid festival starting on July 20th and have had to increase prices. The trade is helped by increased live export buying and will be further supported following the Eid festival as breeding and store sales commence. Cull ewes are also in strong demand with €3.60/kg available. Farmers should continue to sell hard in these favourable market conditions.

<h3>Beef Update</h3>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said tight supplies and strong market demand leaves factories under further pressure to secure suitable supplies of finished cattle. He said market conditions are strong as demand from the food service sector increases for the summer. He said steers are making €4.20/4.30kg with heifers making €4.25/4.40kg with higher deals for larger and specialist lots. The cow trade has moved upwards with deals of up to €4.00kg been secured. Cows ae generally ranging from €3.60/4.00kg. Young Bulls R/U €4.30/4.40kg. Bord Bia predict supplies of finished cattle to reduce up to 120,000 head this year leaving favorable conditions for finishers. Brendan Golden said farmers should sell hard as factories struggle to match supplies with market demand.</p>

<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said demand for lamb is expected to improve over the coming weeks. Strong demand for live shipping and buying for the Eid Festival in mid-July is starting in earnest. Following this, breeding sales and store buying will increase competition for lambs. He said factories must stand firm in the market place. Irish lamb as it stands is competitively priced to compete in the market and there is no need or justification for further cuts. The IFA Sheep Committee will be meeting with factories in the coming days to set out farmers’ frustration at the recent attempts to severely undermine the trade and the need to maximise returns to sheep farmers from a favourable market environment. He said factories must take a stand.  “Farmers cannot continue to be expected to absorb higher production costs on the one hand while allowing the large supermarkets determine the price we receive,” he said. </p>

Beef Update
IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said tight supplies and strong market demand leaves factories under further pressure to secure suitable supplies of finished cattle. He said market conditions are strong as demand from the food service sector increases for the summer. He said steers are making €4.20/4.30kg with heifers making €4.25/4.40kg with higher deals for larger and specialist lots. The cow trade has moved upwards with deals of up to €4.00kg been secured. Cows ae generally ranging from €3.60/4.00kg. Young Bulls R/U €4.30/4.40kg. Bord Bia predict supplies of finished cattle to reduce up to 120,000 head this year leaving favorable conditions for finishers. Brendan Golden said farmers should sell hard as factories struggle to match supplies with market demand.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said demand for lamb is expected to improve over the coming weeks. Strong demand for live shipping and buying for the Eid Festival in mid-July is starting in earnest. Following this, breeding sales and store buying will increase competition for lambs. He said factories must stand firm in the market place. Irish lamb as it stands is competitively priced to compete in the market and there is no need or justification for further cuts. The IFA Sheep Committee will be meeting with factories in the coming days to set out farmers’ frustration at the recent attempts to severely undermine the trade and the need to maximise returns to sheep farmers from a favourable market environment. He said factories must take a stand.  “Farmers cannot continue to be expected to absorb higher production costs on the one hand while allowing the large supermarkets determine the price we receive,” he said.

<h3>Beef Update</h3>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have risen a further 5c/kg this week.<br/>He said demand is strong and numbers are extremely tight as demand from the food service sector improves throughout the EU. “Young Bull prices have strengthened over the past week, reflecting the stronger EU market for beef. Cattle supplies are predicted to be extremely tight over the coming months and as the seasonal summer<br/>demand increases the volume of sales, factories must maximise returns to farmers in favourable market conditions,” he said. He said last week’s kill was 28,804. With the steer and heifer kill back 1,164 and 684, respectively, it<br/>highlights the extremely tight supplies of prime cattle available to factories.</p>
<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said the current price cutting by factories of lamb prices is unnecessary and must stop. Factories are paying €6.50 to €6.70/kg today for lambs, which leaves Irish lamb very competitive in our key markets. “The EID al-Adha festival, which runs from the 19th to the 23rd July, will increase demand for lamb and factories will be anxious to secure supplies to fill these orders over the coming weeks,” he said. “Following this boost to the market, breeding sales and store buying will be starting and will add competition and help underpin the trade,” he said. Sean Dennehy said weekly supplies of spring lamb remain below last year’s levels, with last week’s kill recording 6,500 fewer lambs than the corresponding week in 2020. Demand is extremely strong for cull ewes with factories paying up to €3.60/kg. The IFA Sheep Chairman said factories must stand firm in the market place and stop the unnecessary price cutting.</p>

<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy has called on Minister McConalogue to implement the necessary controls as a matter of urgency to tackle the issue of irresponsible dog ownership. He said farmers’ patience with the authorities on this issue is fast running out. An incident in the last week left over twenty more fatalities from dog attacks in Co Tipperary. Sean Dennehy said the significant increase of dog attacks in recent months is a serious concern for sheep farmers and the message is simply not getting through. “The Minister must advance controls and enforcements for negligent dog owners. We need a single national database for all dogs in the country that identifies the dog owner who is responsible,” he said. “There must be appropriate sanctions in place for those who fail to have their dog under control at all times, and for those whose dogs are identified worrying/attacking livestock,” he said.</p>

<p>“Factories are actively seeking cattle and base prices have moved on 5c/kg.  Steers are making €4.15/kg to €4.20/kg, with heifers making €4.20-€4.30/kg in some factories with higher deals for larger and specialist lots,” he said.</p>

<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>IFA Sheep committee chairman Sean Dennehy said factories are freely offering €7.60/kg and deals on transport to secure lambs with higher deals available for larger numbers. Cull ewes are making €3.20 to €3.50/kg. Sean Dennehy said supplies of suitable finished lambs are tight and market conditions are strong. Hogget supplies have significantly decreased in recent weeks reducing the number of sheep available for slaughter. He said the kill to-date is running 8% behind last year and with the cold weather slowing lamb finish, the number of suitable lambs available remain low. A total of 1,001,500 sheep have been processed in the first 22 weeks of 2021 which is running 78,855 behind the same period in 2020.</p>

Brendan Golden said shed cattle are gone through the system and the poor grass growth will delay grass cattle further tightening available supplies. He said market conditions are strong as demand from the food service sector increases for the summer months and more reopening’s take place.

<h3>Beef Update</h3>
<p>Speaking at a Charter of Rights meeting, IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said, “The letters that issued to 1,000 farmers in the BEAM scheme referencing ‘Associated Herds’ has completely changed the goal posts for these farmers.  This is unacceptable at this late stage in the scheme”. Brendan Golden said that DAFM going back and readjusting the scheme figures for these farmers is a fundamental retrospective change to the Terms and Conditions signed up to by participant farmers. IFA called for DAFM to allow farmers to ‘opt-in’ for these readjusted figures but they cannot enforce a compulsory change for all farmers affected. </p>

<h3>Beef Update</h3>
<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said the full takeover of Slaney Meats and ICM by ABP is a further erosion of competition in the processing sector. “This consolidation of the buying power for livestock in the hands of a few has to be addressed by the Minister for Agriculture and the CPCC,” he said. It comes five years after a joint venture in which ABP took a 50% share in the businesses. He said this latest move renews the urgency for the Minister to implement the primary legislation to provide the office of the Food Regulator with the powers necessary to investigate and enforce at all levels throughout the supply chain. He said returns to livestock farmers must be maximised from the market place.  In order to achieve this, it’s critical we have full transparency on margins throughout the process.</p>

<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said market conditions for sheep meat are positive this week as factories actively seek lambs and hoggets fit for slaughter. Supplies are tight with last week’s kill 9,339 less than the same week in 2020. Year to date throughput is down 8% on 2020 figures. “Hoggets are particularly scare at the moment with quality available varied” he said.  Both factory agents and wholesalers are actively looking for stock and supplies remain tight.  “Lamb is moving well at retail level and the end of Ramadan and upcoming Eid al-Fitr is giving it an additional boost,” he said. The IFA sheep Chairman said farmers should select their lambs carefully and move numbers as they become fit.</p>

<p>“The CCPC has continually failed farmers in this area.  The figures speak for themselves: breakeven prices for beef are €4.50/kg, but this is rarely achieved due to a combination of factors including lack of competition in the processing sector; high dependence on large supermarket chains; and the powers they have been allowed establish and the importation to our key markets of sub-standard produce,” he said.</p>
<p>The IFA President said the Beef Task Force has been very frustrating, particularly the failure of Grant Thornton to identify margins along the food chain.</p>
<p>In 2016, an independent report commissioned by the IFA on the joint venture raised serious competition issues for farmers.</p>
<p>The main conclusion of the report was that the primary procurement market for farmers selling cattle in Ireland to the meat factories is characterised by weak competition and the deal is likely to weaken competition even further, through a ‘substantial lessening of competition’ (SLC).</p>
<p>“It was very clear on the competition concerns in the beef sector, the income pressures that exist for livestock producers and the impact that any weakening of competition would have on their livelihoods”.</p>
<p>The Irish beef processing industry is much more concentrated than that in England (which is about the same size as the Irish cattle procurement market), with large processors (slaughtering more than 50,000 head of cattle) accounting for 85% of the kill compared to 50% in England. In contrast, small and medium sized processors account for 43.3% of the kill in England and only 8.9% in Ireland.</p>
<p>On sheep meat, the report pointed out that Slaney/ICM is the largest processor of sheep/lamb meat in the State, with around 40% of the kill.  While ABP does not process sheep/lamb meat in Ireland, it is active in this area in Northern Ireland and in England. </p>

IFA President Tim Cullinan said the full takeover of Slaney Meats and ICM by ABP is a further erosion of competition in the processing sector.
“This consolidation of the buying power for livestock in the hands of a few has to be addressed by the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue and the Consumer Protection and Competition Commission (CPCC),” he said.
It comes five years after a joint venture in which ABP took a 50% share in the businesses.

<h3>Beef Update</h3>
<p>At a recent meeting with Meat Industry Ireland (MII), IFA called for all meat processors to offer Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) as a method of payment to farmers for cattle and sheep sales. IFA President Tim Cullinan has written to all MII requesting all its members offer the EFT facility to farmers selling animals. “The recent announcement that one of MII’s members will offer EFT is a positive move and we are now requesting that all other processors provide the same facility,” he said. IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said it’s imperative and long overdue that EFT is offered by all meat processors, citing the COVID-19 pandemic as an example of why we need to move forward with this.</p>

<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said market conditions for sheep meat are favourable, underpinned by strong supermarket performance, tight supplies and reduced volumes of imported lamb in our key markets. Total lamb imports to the EU 27 and the UK from New Zealand are down 23% year on year, with EU 27 down 27% and the UK down 20%. The sales of lamb in supermarkets continues to perform strongly, increasing in volume and value by 12% and 6% respectively for the latest 12-week period. Last week’s kill at just under 48,000 was 3,000 below the corresponding week in 2020, with the total numbers processed this year almost 60,000 below last year’s levels.</p>

Beef Update
At a recent meeting with Meat Industry Ireland (MII), IFA called for all meat processors to offer Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) as a method of payment to farmers for cattle and sheep sales. IFA President Tim Cullinan has written to all MII requesting all its members offer the EFT facility to farmers selling animals. “The recent announcement that one of MII’s members will offer EFT is a positive move and we are now requesting that all other processors provide the same facility,” he said. IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said it’s imperative and long overdue that EFT is offered by all meat processors, citing the COVID-19 pandemic as an example of why we need to move forward with this.

Sheep Update
IFA Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said market conditions for sheep meat are favourable, underpinned by strong supermarket performance, tight supplies and reduced volumes of imported lamb in our key markets. Total lamb imports to the EU 27 and the UK from New Zealand are down 23% year on year, with EU 27 down 27% and the UK down 20%. The sales of lamb in supermarkets continues to perform strongly, increasing in volume and value by 12% and 6% respectively for the latest 12-week period. Last week’s kill at just under 48,000 was 3,000 below the corresponding week in 2020, with the total numbers processed this year almost 60,000 below last year’s levels.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/revised-figures-point-to-tighter-cattle-supplies/,Revised Figures Point to Tighter Cattle Supplies,23 April 2021,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the updated cattle supply projection provided by Bord Bia points to tighter supplies of finished cattle for the year.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said the revised figures predict cattle numbers will be some 120,000 fewer this year compared to 2020.</p>
<p>The projection is based on a number of factors, including the very strong export performance of forward store and finished cattle to NI so far this year.  This trend is expected to continue, where exports to-date are up 117% on last year to 24,513.</p>
<p>“Coupled with the estimated 5% reduction in the UK kill for the year, this points to strong and favourable market conditions for Irish beef which must be maximised by factories here and returned in beef prices to farmers,” he said.</p>
<p>The full re-opening of the food service sector in mid-May in the UK will increase demand for Irish beef in particular, as the favoured supplier to this key market.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said beef prices continue to rise as factories struggle to meet demand.</p>
<p>Steers are making €4.05 to €4.10/kg and heifers €4.10 to €4.20/kg base prices, with higher deals available.</p>
<p>Young Bulls R/U grades are making €4.00 to €4.30/kg. Cull cow demand is very strong, with prices for P grades starting at €3.25/kg and moving upwards depending on numbers. O grades are starting at €3.30/kg, with good quality continental cows making €3.50/kg to €3.70/kg.</p>
<p>“The gap with the Prime Export Tracker Price has closed in the last week, but increasing UK prices and the additional demand from the food service sector there for beef is driving the trade. Farmers should sell hard in favourable market conditions,” he said.</p>

<h3>Beef Update</h3>
<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan held a meeting with the Tanáiste and Minister for Trade Leo Varadkar yesterday, at which he insisted that the Government must reject the proposed EU Commission trade deal with the Mercosur countrie. IFA National Livestock Chair Brendan Golden said it’s hugely hypocritical for the Commission to be preaching about the Farm to Fork and Green Deal strategies, while at the same time facilitating wide scale environmental degradation in South America. “The EU Commission cannot have it both ways. They expect the highest standards from farmers here, yet they are willing to sign a deal like this. If the ideals of the EU Commission are to stand for anything, this has to be stopped in its tracks,” he said.</p>

<h3><strong>Sheep Update</strong></h3>
<p>IFA National Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said hogget prices have hit €8.00/kg as factories struggle to match supplies with market demand. He said factories are paying €7.70-€8.00/kg for QA hoggets as Ramadan and strong supermarket sales of lamb drive the trade. Sean Dennehy said up to €8.50/kg is being paid for spring lamb. Cull ewes are ranging from €3.20-€3.50/kg in general. He said the strong factory demand is feeding through to the mart sales where agents and wholesalers are competing strongly for the limited numbers of hoggets, lambs and cull ewes available.  Prices are comparable to and in cases above what factories are offering some farmers.</p>
<p><strong>Lamb Price Update 15/04/21</strong></p>
<p>QA Hoggets €7.80/8.00kg. Spring Lamb €8.30/8.50kg. Higher deals for groups and larger lots. Strong demand. Ewes €3.20/3.50kg.</p>

Beef Update
IFA President Tim Cullinan held a meeting with the Tanáiste and Minister for Trade Leo Varadkar yesterday, at which he insisted that the Government must reject the proposed EU Commission trade deal with the Mercosur countrie. IFA National Livestock Chair Brendan Golden said it’s hugely hypocritical for the Commission to be preaching about the Farm to Fork and Green Deal strategies, while at the same time facilitating wide scale environmental degradation in South America. “The EU Commission cannot have it both ways. They expect the highest standards from farmers here, yet they are willing to sign a deal like this. If the ideals of the EU Commission are to stand for anything, this has to be stopped in its tracks,” he said.

<h3>Beef Update</h3>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the phased re-opening of the food service sector in the UK will increase demand for Irish beef and must translate into higher beef prices. “The food service sector in the UK is a key outlet for Irish beef and the phased re-opening from next Monday is a significant development for beef sales,” he said. He said prices continue to edge upwards, but are not closing the gap with the Prime Export Benchmark price, which is at 11c/kg. The food service sector in the UK is scheduled for full reopening in May.  This will increase demand for beef in the coming weeks and must return meaningful beef price increases,” he said. Prices for next week have increased by a further 5c/kg.</p>

<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>IFA National Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said the demand for hoggets, lambs and cull ewes is stronger again this week. He said the combination of the start of Ramadan next week and supermarket demand is driving the trade. Sean Dennehy said hoggets are making up to €8.00/kg, with higher deals available for larger lots.   Spring lamb is making €8.20/kg, with deals available for groups and larger lots. He said the cull ewe trade is strong, with prices of €3.50/kg paid. Sean Dennehy said the mart trade is providing a real competitive alternative, where prices are comparable, or in some instances, above what factories are offering.  There’s a particularly strong trade for fleshed cull ewes. </p>

Beef Update
IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the phased re-opening of the food service sector in the UK will increase demand for Irish beef and must translate into higher beef prices. “The food service sector in the UK is a key outlet for Irish beef and the phased re-opening from next Monday is a significant development for beef sales,” he said. He said prices continue to edge upwards, but are not closing the gap with the Prime Export Benchmark price, which is at 11c/kg. The food service sector in the UK is scheduled for full reopening in May.  This will increase demand for beef in the coming weeks and must return meaningful beef price increases,” he said. Prices for next week have increased by a further 5c/kg.

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said there are no excuses left for factories failing to return the value of the market in beef prices.</p>
<p>The UK price has risen by 8c/kg in the past week, driven by supermarket demand; the anticipated re-opening of the food service sector; and extremely tight supplies of cattle.</p>
<p>The latest Prime Export Tracker Price is €3.87/kg, with our price lagging behind by 12c/kg at €3.75/kg.</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said numbers of cattle here are not meeting demand from the market place and immediate and substantial price rises are justified.</p>
<p>“It’s time to call a halt to the control meat factories have exerted on beef prices over the past number of weeks and make them pay the market returns,” he said.</p>
<p>The value of Irish beef in comparison to our main markets has now moved well past the €4/kg base price and this must be the immediate target.</p>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the blatant profiteering of meat factories off the back of farmers in a surging beef market must stop.</p>
<p>He said the Minister for Agriculture has a role to ensure Irish farmers get the full market value of their animals.</p>
<p>“There is no point in us hearing about how high our standards are and how many markets we can access when the value of these markets is not returned to farmers,” he said.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said the uncertainty of Brexit has been removed and the new import controls have been pushed out.</p>
<p>“Factories are offering up to €3.90/kg base price for steers and €3.95/kg for heifers.  Farmers should sell hard as factories need the cattle,” he said.</p>

<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden has strongly criticised factories for failing to reflect the strength of the market conditions for beef in current prices.</p>
<p>He said prices paid by factories are not closing the gap with the Prime Export Benchmark Price which has increased by a further 4c to €3.87/kg.</p>
<p>The Prime Irish Price for the same period increased by 3c to €3.74/kg, leaving a gap of 13c/kg.</p>
<p>“Factories are dragging their heels in reflecting the true value of the market place and the 5c/kg weekly price increases are falling short of where the market is at,” he said.</p>
<p>He said the €3.85 and €3.90/kg being offered this week for steers and heifers is not reflective of the demand for beef and the prices paid in our key export markets.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said the base line must move to €4.00/kg to reflect the current prices in the UK and EU markets.</p>
<p>“Supermarket demand for beef will strengthen further for Easter and with supplies extremely tight factories must increase prices paid to farmers to bring them in line with the Bord Bia published Export Tracker price.”</p>
<p>Winter finishers are experiencing a continual increase in production costs and beef prices must reflect this.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said part of the issue is the dominance of supermarkets in the market place and our increased dependency due to the closures of the food service sector which must be called out.</p>
<p>He said offerings of beef at heavily discounted prices by supermarkets to drive footfall in stores is undermining the value of our product and must be stopped.</p>
<p>IFA’s current campaign highlights the behaviour of major retailers and the impact this has on farm incomes.</p>
<p>He said the Minister for Agriculture must ensure the office of the Food Regulator/Ombudsman has the powers necessary to investigate all aspects of the supply chain with robust primary legislation that protects farmers from the powers of large corporations involved in food processing and retail.</p>

<h3>Beef Update</h3>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden has encouraged farmers to apply for BEEP-S, which opened this week.</p>
<p>Last year, over 24,000 farmers applied for the scheme. “Suckler farmers are the backbone of our beef industry and IFA continues to look for strong supports for them,” he said.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said under BEEP–S, participants may be eligible for up to €90 for the first 10 suckler cow/calf pairs per herd and up to €80 per pair thereafter subject to an overall maximum of 100 pairs per herd, if all actions under the scheme are applied for and completed in full.</p>
<p>He reminded farmers that the closing date is Monday, April 26th.</p>

Beef Update
IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden has encouraged farmers to apply for BEEP-S, which opened this week.
Last year, over 24,000 farmers applied for the scheme. “Suckler farmers are the backbone of our beef industry and IFA continues to look for strong supports for them,” he said.
Brendan Golden said under BEEP–S, participants may be eligible for up to €90 for the first 10 suckler cow/calf pairs per herd and up to €80 per pair thereafter subject to an overall maximum of 100 pairs per herd, if all actions under the scheme are applied for and completed in full.
He reminded farmers that the closing date is Monday, April 26th.

Sheep Update
IFA National Sheep Committee Chairman Sean Dennehy said QA hoggets are making €7.30-7.40/kg, with deals to €7.50/kg. 
Higher deals are available for groups and larger lots.  Cull ewes are making from €2.90-€3.20/kg.
“Factory demand is strong with supply numbers remaining tight,” he said.
Sean Dennehy said the mart trade continues to strengthen, with strong competition for the limited supply of hoggets available.
Farmers should sell hard, while moving hoggets as they become fit.

<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the announcement by the UK Government of the revised timetable for SPS checks and controls removes uncertainty in our key export for the next number of months.</p>
<p>“Factories can continue to access the market without the uncertainty of the impact of additional checks and controls that were scheduled for April and July. This is a very positive development for beef sales and the clarity must be returned in higher prices to farmers,” he said.</p>
<p>There will be no new impediments to our trade with the UK in the coming months and the strong demand for beef in that market must come through in beef prices.</p>
<p>The additional access to the Japanese market for minced beef is a positive development for beef exports and must translate into higher returns.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said numbers are tight, the UK supplies are predicted to be down 5% this year and beef sales in supermarkets continue to show both volume and value growth. Prices in the UK are strengthening.</p>
<p>“Easter will increase demand in supermarkets and the gradual re-opening of the food service sector as vaccinations are rolled out will further increase demand for beef,” he said.</p>
<p>The latest Prime Export Benchmark price shows continued growth in our key markets for beef, rising by a further 1c/kg to €3.83/kg.  The Irish Prime Composite price rose by 2c/kg for the same period to €3.71/kg.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said this still leaves an unacceptable price gap of 12c/kg which must be closed.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said factories have no excuses left.  The uncertainty of access issues to the UK market has been removed, demand is strong and prices are rising across our key markets.</p>
<p>He said factories are paying €3.80/kg for steers, up to €3.90/kg for heifers and are prepared to do deals for larger numbers above these levels including paying increased breed bonuses.</p>
<p>Young Bulls are making €3.70/kg to €3.95/kg, cows are making €3.00/kg to €3.50/kg depending on grade.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said farmers should demand immediate price increases to reflect the strength of the market; the removal of Brexit uncertainty; and the growing demand for beef.</p>

Beef Update
Brendan Golden said numbers are tight, the UK supplies are predicated to be down 5% this year and beef sales in supermarkets continue to show both volume and value growth. Prices in the UK are strengthening. 
Brendan Golden said the latest Prime Export Benchmark price shows continued growth in our key markets for beef rising by a further 1c/kg to €3.83/kg, the Irish Prime Composite price rose by 2c/kg for the same period to €3.71/kg. The IFA livestock chairman said this still leaves an unacceptable price gap of 12c/kg which must be closed. He said farmers should demand immediate price increases to reflect to the strength of the market, removal of Brexit uncertainty and growing demand for beef.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/mii-claims-on-beef-price-simply-dont-add-up/,MII Claims on Beef Price Simply Don’t Add Up,10 March 2021,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan has rejected today’s claims by MII around beef prices.</p>
<p>“At last night’s IFA online Beef meeting, attended by 250 farmers, the fact that the Irish price is now 13c behind the Bord Bia Prime Export Benchmark price was highlighted, which is based on a weighted composite price in our main export markets,” he said.</p>
<p>“Beef prices must push on and reflect the reality of the market place,” he said.</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said despite the claims of MII, Grant Thornton admitted to the Task Force that it doesn’t have the authority to access the information needed for a full and independent appraisal of the value of beef at all points in the supply chain.</p>
<p>Because of these constraints, the output is based only on the information that participants are willing to provide.</p>
<p>“Minister McConalogue outlined the importance of greater transparency in the supply chain and he must now come forward with the primary legislation that allows the Office of the Food Ombudsman/Regulator source and provide this information independently,” he said.</p>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said at last night’s meeting farmers expressed disbelief that the EU Commission are attempting to proceed with the Mercosur deal with South American countries.</p>
<p>“It is unbelievable that following Brexit and the added environmental and production controls the EU are imposing on Irish farmers through the CAP that they are looking at allowing more beef into the EU market to further undermine Irish and EU farmers,” he said.</p>
<p>“We will be meeting the Tánaiste and Minister for Trade Leo Varadkar shortly to put the strongest message across that the Irish Government must oppose the deal,” he said.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said market conditions are strong for beef and are expected to improve, supplies of cattle are tight and factories must return the full value of the market place in increased beef prices.</p>
<p>He said the Easter demand and the returning food service sector in the UK and throughout the EU as vaccines are rolled out will further drive demand for beef. The strong performance of beef in supermarkets is reflecting changes in consumer purchasing habits.</p>
<p>Predictions for the year are of tight supplies of finished cattle in Ireland, the UK and the EU, creating favourable market conditions for Irish beef which must be reflected in prices.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said prices are strengthening as factories and agents work hard to secure supplies. Steers are making €3.80/kg, heifers €3.85/kg with higher deals for larger and specialist lots. The cow trade also strengthened this week, ranging from €3.00/kg to €3.50/kg with some higher prices paid. Young bulls are making €3.65 to €3.95/kg depending on grade.</p>
<p>Prices in marts for finished and forward store cattle and cows are strong and providing a real competitive alternative for some farmers.</p>

“We will be meeting the Tánaiste and Minister for Trade Leo Varadkar shortly to put the strongest message across that the Irish Government must oppose the deal,” he said.
Brendan Golden said market conditions are strong for beef and are expected to improve, supplies of cattle are tight and factories must return the full value of the market place in increased beef prices.
He said the Easter demand and the returning food service sector in the UK and throughout the EU as vaccines are rolled out will further drive demand for beef. The strong performance of beef in supermarkets is reflecting changes in consumer purchasing habits.
Predictions for the year are of tight supplies of finished cattle in Ireland, the UK and the EU, creating favourable market conditions for Irish beef which must be reflected in prices.
Brendan Golden said prices are strengthening as factories and agents work hard to secure supplies. Steers are making €3.80/kg, heifers €3.85/kg with higher deals for larger and specialist lots. The cow trade also strengthened this week, ranging from €3.00/kg to €3.50/kg with some higher prices paid. Young bulls are making €3.65 to €3.95/kg depending on grade.
Prices in marts for finished and forward store cattle and cows are strong and providing a real competitive alternative for some farmers.

<h3>Sheep Update</h3>
<p>IFA National Chairman Sean Dennehy said QA hoggets are making €7.00 to 7.15kg with deals to €7.20/kg. Higher deals available for larger lots and groups.  Prices are driven by very strong demand and tight supplies of finished hoggets. Factory agents are very active in marts and competing strongly with wholesalers for the limited supplies that are available. Cull ewes are making €2.80 to €3.20/kg<strong></strong></p>
<p>Sean Dennehy said orderly marketing is important to maximise returns. Farmers should sell hard while moving hoggets as they become fit.</p>

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan will chair the meeting, which comes at a very difficult time for beef finishers in particular.</p>
<p>“The factories have pulled prices in recent weeks, to an extent that is not justified. We want to hear the views of beef farmers as we discuss the current price situation, Brexit, Mercosur and CAP,” he said.</p>
<p>“The next CAP will need to support vulnerable sectors and recognise that beef farmers are the foundation of our beef sector. IFA will be seeking maximum funds from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve, and beef farmers have been most exposed from the UK exit,” he said.</p>
<p>The meeting will hear a presentation by the Senior Policy Executive for Livestock Tómas Bourke and from the National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said Direct Payments play a huge role in the viability of beef and suckler farms, accounting for 160% of family farm income.  The value of payments in the new CAP to the livestock sector cannot be eroded. A targeted payment of €300 for suckler cows is critical.</p>
<p>He said the market place can also offer significantly more to Irish beef farmers if the double standards in EU trade deals is addressed. “The Mercosur trade deal must be stopped and the existing deals that allow substandard products to undermine our key markets must be aligned with the standards imposed on Irish and EU farmers,” he said.</p>

<h3><strong>Beef Update</strong></h3>
<p>IFA Livestock chairman Brendan Golden said cattle prices are hardening driven by tight supplies and good market demand. He said bullocks are making €3.75 to €3.80/kg, heifers are making €3.80 to €3.85/kg. Factories are also offering increased breed bonuses over the past few days to secure cattle. Higher deals are available for larger and specialist lots. Strengthening sterling and strong performance of beef in supermarket sales is driving the trade. Factory agents are very active in marts and on the ground trying to secure supplies of finished cattle. Young Bulls are ranging from €3.60 to €3.85/kg for O/R/U grades. Cows are ranging from €3.00 and €3.50/kg</p>

Beef Update
IFA Livestock chairman Brendan Golden said cattle prices are hardening driven by tight supplies and good market demand. He said bullocks are making €3.75 to €3.80/kg, heifers are making €3.80 to €3.85/kg. Factories are also offering increased breed bonuses over the past few days to secure cattle. Higher deals are available for larger and specialist lots. Strengthening sterling and strong performance of beef in supermarket sales is driving the trade. Factory agents are very active in marts and on the ground trying to secure supplies of finished cattle. Young Bulls are ranging from €3.60 to €3.85/kg for O/R/U grades. Cows are ranging from €3.00 and €3.50/kg

<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have strengthened in recent days as tight supplies and strong farmer resistance to the lower and unjustified quotes from factories takes effect.</p>
<p>The Prime Export Benchmark Price for the latest week is steady at €3.76/kg, while the equivalent Irish price dropped 5c/kg, which underlines how unjustified the price cuts are.</p>
<p>Steers are making €3.75 to €3.80/kg, with heifers making €3.80 to €3.85/kg. The cow trade is steady, ranging from €2.90 for P grades to €3.40/kg for R and U grades with some higher prices.  Young bulls are ranging from €3.60 to €3.80/kg for R and U grades.</p>
<p>He said IFA left MII in no doubt in our meeting that undermining of the market place by meat factories will not be tolerated and beef prices must reflect the full value of our key markets.</p>
<p>“Supplies of finished cattle are extremely tight. UK slaughter-fit cattle are predicted to be back 5% this year and sterling has continued to strengthen since the end of January. It’s currently at 86p, creating positive market conditions for Irish beef,” he said.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said factories must reverse the price drops of recent weeks and reflect the full value of the market place in cattle prices.</p>
<p>“While sterling is strengthening, it’s still almost 20% behind the pre-Brexit vote levels and impacting directly on incomes for beef farmers.  This is further compounded by sub-standard imports that are allowed into the EU to undermine our key market. The Mercosur trade deal that will allow an additional 100,000t of substandard product into our key markets must be stopped,” he said.</p>
<p>The Brexit Adjustment Fund must prioritise beef farmers who have borne the brunt of the Brexit impact.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said winter finishers are also dealing with the impact of increasing input supplies.  The breakeven price estimated by Teagasc at €4.50/kg is a long way from current prices.</p>

<h3><strong>Sheep Update</strong></h3>
<p>Sean Dennehy said there must be a national ownership database for all dogs that allows those responsible for them be identified.  There must also be appropriate sanctions to act as a deterrent for those who allow their animals to cause this devastation on sheep farms and there must be resources put in place to enforce these sanctions.</p>
<p>He said this is an issue that effects all sheep farmers and it’s not confined to people who are out walking dogs. Frequently, these attacks on sheep are as result of dog owners allowing their pets roam free while they are away at work, or at night time. Dog owners are responsible for having their dogs under control and must be accountable for them at all times.</p>

Sheep Update
Sean Dennehy said there must be a national ownership database for all dogs that allows those responsible for them be identified.  There must also be appropriate sanctions to act as a deterrent for those who allow their animals to cause this devastation on sheep farms and there must be resources put in place to enforce these sanctions.
He said this is an issue that effects all sheep farmers and it’s not confined to people who are out walking dogs. Frequently, these attacks on sheep are as result of dog owners allowing their pets roam free while they are away at work, or at night time. Dog owners are responsible for having their dogs under control and must be accountable for them at all times.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/market-conditions-for-beef-remain-strong/,Market Conditions For Beef Remain Strong,18 February 2021,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said market conditions for beef remains strong.  He said the Export Benchmark Price of €3.77/kg continues to edge upwards, reflecting beef prices in our key export markets.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said the latest published supermarket sales of beef in the UK, to the end of January, show continued growth for beef sales both in terms of volume and price.</p>
<p>The spend on beef in supermarkets for the 12-week period to the 24<sup>th</sup> January year on year increased by 15.8% and volume increased by 13%, combined with sterling strengthening, creates favourable market conditions for beef.</p>
<p>He said supplies of suitable cattle are tight.  When last week’s kill is corrected for finished cattle, the kill was 29,780, which is over 7,000 fewer than the corresponding week in 2020.  The corrected kill to-date is almost 19,000 below the same period last year.</p>
<p>Tight supplies of cattle are predicted for the year.  Irish throughput is projected to be back by up to 80,000 head for the year and UK finished cattle numbers are expected to reduce by 5% compared to last year.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said attempts by factories to undermine the trade with lower quotes are unjustified and are meeting very strong resistance from farmers selling cattle.</p>
<p>He said in general prices are continuing at €3.75 to €3.80/kg for bullocks and heifers despite some factories quoting lower prices. He said some farmers are securing prices above these levels as factories compete for the limited supplies of suitable cattle that are available. The cow trade in the main is steady, starting at €2.90/kg for P grades with most moving into €3/kg and higher on flat deals with O grades, quotes for O grades are between €3 and €3.15/kg with R and U grades from €3.30 to €3.50/kg in general with some higher prices. R and U grading Young bulls are making from €3.60 to €3.80/kg.</p>
<p>Demand from factory agents in marts for all types of finished cattle is strong.</p>
<p>“In our meeting with MII last week, we left the meat industry representative body in doubt that the attempts by factories to undermine the market conditions is unjustified and unacceptable. Winter finishers have the highest cost of production sector in beef farming and are experiencing continual input cost increases and beef prices must reflect these facts,” he said.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden also highlighted the double standards of EU trade policies and the impact these are having on the viability of Irish beef farmers. He said we are seeing the standards and production costs on our farms continually increase while trade deals allow our market be undermined by substandard imports.</p>
<p>Beef farmers are also dealing with the fall out of the Brexit vote since 2016, where the devaluation of sterling that took place impacted directly on our prices, a situation that has not recovered and must be taken into account in the Brexit Adjustment Fund, in addition to any obstacles that are encountered in accessing our main market.</p>
<p>He said beef farmers must be first in line for this fund, having experienced the Brexit impact directly since 2016.</p>

<h2>Beef</h2>
<p>At a meeting with MII on beef price cuts IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden highlighted the level of farmer frustration at the attempts by factories to reduce prices and the increased production costs associated with finished cattle at this stage of the year. In addition, he said meal prices continue to rise. Brendan Golden said the situation is further compounded by the double standards applied by the EU when it comes to trade deals in comparison to the standards imposed on Irish and EU farmers. “Our key EU and UK markets continue to be undermined by imports from countries not meeting our production standards,” he said.</p>

<h2>Sheep</h2>
<p>IFA National Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy said the issue of new entrants to the Sheep Welfare Scheme must be resolved.  This follows the Minister’s success in securing 2017 as the reference year from the EU Commission for this year. Sean Dennehy said the objective must be to accurately reflect the levels of activity on farms.  New entrants in particular are not having their sheep numbers recognised. “The scheme conditions, which require new entrants to apply effectively within a year of starting, creates an anomalous situation that unfairly penalises them. This can and must be addressed in the Terms and Conditions of the scheme for 2021,” he said.</p>

Beef
At a meeting with MII on beef price cuts IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden highlighted the level of farmer frustration at the attempts by factories to reduce prices and the increased production costs associated with finished cattle at this stage of the year. In addition, he said meal prices continue to rise. Brendan Golden said the situation is further compounded by the double standards applied by the EU when it comes to trade deals in comparison to the standards imposed on Irish and EU farmers. “Our key EU and UK markets continue to be undermined by imports from countries not meeting our production standards,” he said.

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan led an IFA delegation to meet Meat Industry Ireland (MII) on the recent price cuts attempted by factories.</p>
<p>He told the industry representative body the recent attempts by factories to reduce beef prices are not justified based on current market information, and farmers have reacted angrily to these attempts by factories.</p>
<p>He said the Bord Bia Prime Export Benchmark price tracker for the latest week, which is a composite of prices in our main export markets, does not show anything like the cuts factories are trying to enforce here.</p>
<p>Beef prices in the UK are strong and steady, rising over 7p/kg since the beginning of January and with sterling strengthening by 3% over the same period to 87.6p/€, market conditions for Irish meat factories are favourable.</p>
<p>Supplies of finished cattle are tight and estimated to reduce by up to 80,000 head this year.  UK production for the year is predicted to contract by 5%.</p>
<p>Recognising there are clearly ongoing issues with the food service sector due to COVID-19 controls, Tim Cullinan said the supermarket price for beef in the UK strengthened in the past week and sales remain strong as purchasing habits have evolved throughout the past year and are replicated by EU consumers.</p>

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said resolving the 5% issue in the BEAM Scheme will require more than the additional six months extension that has been announced. </p>
<p>He said the full extent of the latitude given by the EU Commission must be outlined by the Minister for Agriculture, and fully availed of.</p>
<p>“It appears the EU Commission is willing to give more latitude than just the six months. IFA has sought a meeting with the Minister to establish the full scope of their response and to ensure it’s applied to the scheme,” he said.</p>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said this scheme is based on the losses farmers experienced from the devaluation in sterling as a result of the Brexit vote.  Those losses are as real today as they were between September 2018 and May 2019.  These monies must be protected and a key issue is the lack of clear and concise information for farmers in monitoring their compliance levels.</p>
<p>“The Department of Agriculture must provide farmers with detailed monthly updates of the actual position on their farm in meeting the target. IFA has consistently identified this information deficit as a critical issue for farmers in complying with the scheme.  Without this, key management decisions are being taken in the dark and time extensions alone will not resolve this,” he said.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said farmers who have a TB breakdown or any other exceptional event on their farm must have this treated as Force Majeure and the 5% requirement removed. </p>
<p>He said a speedy finalisation of this issue is vital to allow farmers plan the year ahead and avoid any market disruption.  This resolution must take full advantage of the autonomy now given to the Minister by the Commission. </p>

<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said attempts by the meat factories to talk down the trade are not justified based on the latest market reports.</p>
<p>He said the Prime Export Benchmark price for the latest week has increased by 5c/kg, with the Irish price not keeping pace, only increasing by 2c/kg over the same period.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said the supermarket price for beef in the UK has strengthened in the past week and sales remain strong.</p>
<p>Beef prices in the UK are strong and steady, rising over 7p/kg since the beginning of January and with sterling strengthening by 3% over the same period to 87.5p/€, market conditions for Irish meat factories are favourable.</p>
<p>Supplies of finished cattle are tight, in addition UK production for the year is predicted to contract by 5%.</p>
<p>Bullocks and heifers have been bought at €3.80 and €3.85/kg by factories for this week and factory agents remain active in marts sales for finished cattle.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said the double standards applied by the EU when it comes to trade deals in comparison to the standards imposed on Irish and EU farmers is not helping the situation. “Our key EU and UK markets continue to be undermined by imports from countries that are not meeting our production standards,” he said.</p>
<p>The current Prime Export Benchmark price of €3.76/kg, which is based on prices in our key markets, highlights the dysfunction of the EU policy when it comes to beef farmers, an approach that must be stopped. This price is up to 80c/kg below production costs for Irish beef farmers.</p>
<p>At the IFA AGM last month, Taoiseach Micheál Martin talked about realigning food prices with production costs. IFA has continuously raised this issue at national and EU level.</p>
<p>“We must start seeing meaningful action on this front and the first steps must be to reject the Mercosur deal and remove the existing sub-standard imports from the market place. In addition, supermarkets have a key role in this and the influence they have been allowed exert in food pricing throughout the EU must be curtailed,” he said.</p>

<h3>Beef Update</h3>
<p>Brendan Golden said the EU Commission cannot defend current or future trade agreements when it shows that by 2030 beef imports into the EU can increase by up to 100,000t and in the process reduce beef prices for Irish and EU farmers by a further 2.2%, in a sector that is already accepted as extremely vulnerable and operating on a below cost basis.</p>
<p>He said this week factories are slowing the kill and attempting to ease prices with some quoting €3.80/kg for heifers.  Most cattle are moving at a base of €3.80 for steers and €3.85/kg for heifers.</p>

<h2>Sheep Update</h2>
<p>Sean Dennehy said dog attacks remain a significant problem and can devastate the farmers whose sheep suffer an attack. Sean Dennehy said there must be better enforcement of existing legislation around dog ownership; more stringent fines for dog attacks; increased funding for the dog warden service; and a single database for microchipped dogs. All farm animals are fully traceable, and dogs should also be.</p>

Beef Update
Brendan Golden said the EU Commission cannot defend current or future trade agreements when it shows that by 2030 beef imports into the EU can increase by up to 100,000t and in the process reduce beef prices for Irish and EU farmers by a further 2.2%, in a sector that is already accepted as extremely vulnerable and operating on a below cost basis.
He said this week factories are slowing the kill and attempting to ease prices with some quoting €3.80/kg for heifers.  Most cattle are moving at a base of €3.80 for steers and €3.85/kg for heifers.

Sheep Update
Sean Dennehy said dog attacks remain a significant problem and can devastate the farmers whose sheep suffer an attack. Sean Dennehy said there must be better enforcement of existing legislation around dog ownership; more stringent fines for dog attacks; increased funding for the dog warden service; and a single database for microchipped dogs. All farm animals are fully traceable, and dogs should also be.

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said the EU Commission must address the serious contradictions and lack of policy co-ordination under the Green deal, CAP and trade policies.</p>
<p>“Commissioner Wojciechowski admitted to MEPs that of all the sectors considered in the Cumulative Impact Assessment on EU Free Trade Agreements, the beef sector stands out as the most affected,” he said.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by the EU’s Joint Research Centre, updated the European Commission’s Assessment from 2016 and looks at the impact of 12 EU Free Trade Agreements with partner countries with modelling conducted out to 2030.</p>
<p>The report estimates the beef sector to reduce production by 0.5%. (tonnes)</p>
<p>“Under the Green deal, the EU is driving up costs and wants organic production standards at conventional prices, while at the same time under trade deals, the Commission is importing beef that fails to meet EU standards and would be illegal to produce in the EU.”</p>
<p>The IFA President said the Mercosur trade deal cannot progress and the existing access granted to beef not produced to our standards, including environmental, societal, traceability and animal health and welfare must be stopped.</p>
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the latest beef market tracker price shows Irish prices running 5c/kg ahead of the Export Benchmark Price, which is at €3.70/kg. This leaves beef prices up to 80c/kg below breakeven prices based on Teagasc calculations.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said the full benefits of the strong supermarket trade for beef in the UK and throughout the EU is undermined by the acceptance of these substandard products to fill some of the demand.</p>
<p>UK supermarkets over the Christmas period increased beef sales by 1.4k/t or 18%, but Irish beef farmers are not seeing the full benefits of this as a result of the flawed and contradictory EU policies on trade.</p>
<p>He said this clearly highlights the dysfunction of the EU beef market caused by the double standards of policy makers who continue to ignore how beef is produced in these countries, while increasing demands on Irish beef farmers.</p>

<p>Predictions are for tighter supplies for the year ahead, with our kill projected to be down 80,000 on last year and UK prime cattle numbers projected to be back 5%. This should create a positive market environment for Irish beef if it’s not continually undermined by flawed EU trade policies.</p>
<p>He said at the same time Irish farmers are seeing the value of the CAP payments eroded through the inclusion of additional measures that reduce on farm efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>He said Irish farmers produce to the highest standards demanded by the EU and must not be undermined in our key markets, where prices are depressed by the flood of cheap and substandard imports.</p>
<p>The EU cannot continue on the diverging paths of higher standards on Irish beef farmers and erosion of the value of the CAP while at the same time selling out on our key markets for beef.</p>

Beef Update
The IFA Livestock Chairman said market conditions are strong, underpinned by high volume and value of sales of beef in supermarkets, and tight supplies of finished cattle.
“Projections are for 80,000 fewer cattle to be available for slaughter this year compared to 2020.  When the strong performance of beef in supermarkets is factored in, where both volume and price have shown huge growth, this creates a positive market environment that must be reflected in beef prices to farmers,” he said.

“The Prime Irish Composite price is currently reported at €3.73/kg (excl. Vat) which is 3c above the Prime Export Benchmark price of €3.70/kg and must continue to push on,” he said.
The breakeven price is €4.50/kg, according to Teagasc, and Brendan Golden said we are still a long way from that.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/farmers-face-e40m-clawback-on-flawed-beam-scheme/,Farmers Face €40m Clawback on Flawed BEAM Scheme,19 January 2021,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said IFA held a constructive and frank discussion with the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue and his senior officials yesterday on the 5% reduction requirement in BEAM scheme.</p>
<p>“There are 18,000 farmers currently not achieving the reduction, which could see these farmers having to hand back as much as €40m out of €77m in the scheme,” he said. </p>
<p>“This was a flawed requirement in the first instance and the COVID-19 controls have made the situation far worse with marts curtailed and farmers unable to engage as normal with their advisers. This must be recognised,” he said.</p>
<p>He said the €77m paid to 33,000 beef and suckler farmers for the market disruption between September 2018 and May 2019 caused by the devaluation of sterling arising from the Brexit vote must be safeguarded.</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said the primary objective must be to get a speedy resolution to this issue that protects this vital support for farmers, and avoids any market disruption caused by farmers trying to play catch up to meet the 5% reduction.</p>
<p>Declan Hanrahan, Vice Chairman of the IFA Livestock Committee said the period of time over which farmers are expected to reduce their stock numbers has been severely disrupted by COVID-19 controls and Brexit uncertainty. He said under this cloud, it’s unreasonable to expect farmers to make these changes to their farming practices.</p>
<p>He said over this time, the mart service, which is the trusted and most used means for animal sales for farmers, operated in a very different and challenging environment for farmers and mart managers.</p>
<p>“The ability of farmers to meet this measure was further impeded by the lack of clear, up to date and easy to follow guidance on herd performance in meeting the target from the Department of Agriculture and the constraints through COVID-19 controls on engaging with their farm advisers.</p>
<p>Declan Hanrahan said under the circumstances, it’s unreasonable to expect suckler and beef farmers to make fundamental changes to their farming systems to meet the 5% reduction requirement.</p>
<p>He said in addition, we have had the loss of the important food service sector for our beef and the ongoing uncertainty of Brexit up to Christmas Eve. This must all be taken into account.  Farmers cannot be expected to make fundamental changes to their businesses with all of this uncertainty hanging over their heads.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Vice Chairman said we have to avoid a situation where farmers who signed up to the scheme in good faith are penalised, when they cannot meet the conditions due to the extreme circumstances.</p>

<p>Sean Dennehy said demand for lambs is very strong from factories and prices continue to push on.</p>
<p>He said lambs are making €6.35 to €6.50/kg with deals of €6.60/kg available and above in cases as factories actively source lambs to meet market demand. The mart trade is also performing very strongly for all types and is particularly strong outlet for heavier lambs. He said it is important to keep lambs moving as they become fit but sell hard with up to 20c/kg difference in prices offered.</p>

The mart trade is also performing very strongly for all types and is particularly strong outlet for heavier lambs. He said it is important to keep lambs moving as they become fit but sell hard with up to 20c/kg difference in prices offered.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/farming-has-substantial-call-on-brexit-funding-of-e1bn/,Farming has Substantial Call on Brexit Funding of €1bn,13 January 2021,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said the announcement that Ireland will receive over €1bn, or 25%, from the EU Brexit fund in 2021 is clear recognition that we are most exposed to the fallout from Brexit.</p>
<p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney confirmed the funding at the AGM of the North Tipperary County Executive last night.</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said when it comes to allocating the funding, the impact on the agri-food sector will have to be central to any decisions.</p>
<p>“We will be making a strong case for funding to go directly to farmers who will take the brunt of any fallout from currency fluctuations and trade and logistical issues that will arise once the deal reached before Christmas works its way through the system,” he said.</p>
<p>“We have real concerns about how non-tariff barriers will impact on our ability to keep trade flows moving. Green Lanes have been implemented previously for food exports. These must be prioritised to allow us reach our markets,” he said.</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan also said the longer-term implication for our food exports could be the flooding of the UK market by cheap imports. “Farmers here on the island of Ireland and in the UK are steadfast in their view of standards,” he said.</p>
<p>We know the UK agenda is to offer access to their food market to Australia, New Zealand Canada, the US and the Mercosur countries of South America in exchange for trade deals with those countries. If that happens, then the value of the UK market for Irish food exports will be cut and Irish farmers will suffer huge income losses, with knock-on effects on EU markets. The level playing field provisions built into this deal by the EU must stop any race to the bottom. </p>

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said a combination of tight supplies and strong supermarket demand is driving the beef trade.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said prices in the UK increased by the equivalent of 4c/kg in the run in to Christmas.</p>
<p>“Supermarket sales of beef throughout the COVID-19 restrictions have performed well, with strong volume and price increases recorded for 2020, a situation that is likely to continue,” he said.</p>
<p>Last year’s kill came in at over 60,000 head more than the 2019 levels, when predictions were for a reduction of in the region of 50,000 head. This earlier movement of animals in 2020 is likely to have a significant impact on numbers of slaughter fit cattle in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>He said prices for steers have moved to a base of €3.75/kg with heifers selling off a base of €3.80/kg.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden reminded farmers the increase to 5.6% in the flat rate vat is the equivalent of almost 1c/kg on beef price at current levels.</p>
<p>Cow prices have also strengthened and are ranging from €2.90/kg to €3.40/kg with deals being done for select lots of younger and better-quality cows. The young bull trade has also moved on with R/U grading bulls making €3.70 to €3.80/kg.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said market conditions are strong in our main export market and with the worst-case scenario for Brexit avoided.  This market must be built on and any trade distortions from logistical access issues cannot find their way back to farmers.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said despite beef prices improving, they continue to fall well short of breakeven levels.</p>
<p>“To address this, the approach must include strong recognition of beef and suckler farming in the new CAP and the removal of beef from the EU market that does not meet the production standards on Irish and EU farms,” he said.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said the double standards applied by the EU cannot be allowed continue.  The Mercosur deal must be rejected and the current access allowed for South American beef that does not meet our environmental welfare production standards must be removed from the market place.</p>

<h3>Brexit</h3>
<p>The UK accounts for 44% of all our beef exports and 20% of lamb exports. IFA’s Brexit Emergency Plan sets out six key measures that are needed to safeguard Irish and European agriculture:</p>
<ol><li>The EU and the UK must maintain the closest possible trading relationship, but the EU Single Market must be protected.</li><li>It is essential to maintain a level playing field with corresponding standards on food safety, animal health and welfare and the environment</li><li>Burdensome delays such as control of goods and sanitary and phytosanitary inspections and veterinary certificates which will lead to delays at borders and increase costs for both sides must be avoided.</li><li>Access to the UK market must be tariff-free and quota-free</li><li>There must be no return by the UK to a cheap food policy</li><li>European Agri sector must be a priority for support from the €5bn Brexit Adjustment Reserve.</li></ol>

Brexit
The UK accounts for 44% of all our beef exports and 20% of lamb exports. IFA’s Brexit Emergency Plan sets out six key measures that are needed to safeguard Irish and European agriculture:
The EU and the UK must maintain the closest possible trading relationship, but the EU Single Market must be protected.It is essential to maintain a level playing field with corresponding standards on food safety, animal health and welfare and the environmentBurdensome delays such as control of goods and sanitary and phytosanitary inspections and veterinary certificates which will lead to delays at borders and increase costs for both sides must be avoided.Access to the UK market must be tariff-free and quota-freeThere must be no return by the UK to a cheap food policyEuropean Agri sector must be a priority for support from the €5bn Brexit Adjustment Reserve.

<p>Addressing the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture this afternoon, IFA President Tim Cullinan said regardless of the final outcome on Brexit, Irish agriculture and Irish farmers stand to lose out most.</p>
<p>“Whether or not a limited deal is achieved, the impact will be a deterioration of trade – what is at issue is the degree of that deterioration,” he said.</p>
<p>Despite massive efforts at market diversification, the UK is the current destination for 38% of Ireland’s overall agri-food exports. That is 44% of all our beef exports, 41% of cheese exports, almost 100% of mushroom exports, 60% of poultry exports, 33% of pigmeat exports, 20% of lamb exports, to name just the main sectors.</p>
<p>The IFA President set out IFA’s Brexit Emergency Plan, which is partly modelled on the EU’s response to the Russian ban on EU food imports in 2014, which shows the EU’s willingness to intervene in significant ways to support farmers faced with the impact of a geopolitical event in which they are powerless.</p>
<p>The value of EU food exports which Brexit will affect is eight times greater than the value of EU exports affected by the 2014 Russian embargo.  The value of Irish agri-food exports potentially affected by Brexit is 60 times greater than affected by the Russian embargo.</p>
<p><br/>Tim Cullinan said a Brexit outcome, which either reduces access for those products to the UK market or makes their continued sale onto that market uneconomic, will be disastrous for European farming and the livelihoods of farmers, particularly from Ireland.</p>
<p><br/>Referring to the ongoing difficulties in reaching an agreement, he said the exit of the UK from the EU without a deal would undoubtedly lead to significant trade disruption and a lose-lose situation for the entire agri-food chain.</p>
<p><br/>“Burdensome and unavoidable procedures, such as official controls of goods, SPS inspections, veterinary certificates and import tariffs will lead to increased delays for checks at borders and raise the costs for both sides,” he said.</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan set out six key measures that are needed to safeguard Irish and European agriculture:</p>
<ul><li>We want the EU and the UK to maintain the closest possible trading relationship, but the EU Single Market must be protected.</li><li>It is essential to maintain a level playing field with corresponding standards on food safety, animal health and welfare and the environment</li><li>We want to avoid burdensome delays such as control of goods and sanitary and phytosanitary inspections and veterinary certificates which will lead to delays at borders and increase costs for both sides.</li><li>Access to the UK market must be tariff-free and quota-free</li><li>There must be no return by the UK to a cheap food policy</li><li>European Agri sector is a priority for support from the €5bn Brexit Adjustment Reserve.</li></ul>
<p>The IFA President said Michel Barnier and his team must continue to pursue an outcome that retains the closest possible trading relationship with the UK.</p>
<p>“The intense discussions to secure a deal must continue, but we must also prepare for the post-Brexit scenario. In that regard, the Irish Government must ensure that Irish farmers are top of the queue for the €5bn EU Brexit fund,” he said. </p>

<p>He said that the Department of Agriculture must commit to giving farmers more time to allow them to adapt to these changes, many of which are challenging.</p>

<p>Speaking at the first trans-national BovINE meeting for the European Beef industry organised by Poland, IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the EU Commission must address the serious contradictions and lack of policy co-ordination under the Green deal, CAP and Trade policy. </p>
<p>“Under the Green Deal, the EU is driving up costs and want organic production standards at conventional prices, while at the same time under the Mercosur trade deal, the Commission is importing beef that fails to meet EU standards and would be illegal to produce in the EU.”</p>
<p>The online BovINE meeting entitled Sustainable Beef farming; Policy and Practice in the context of the Green Deal was also addressed by the Polish Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development Grzegorz Puda, Thomas Sanchez from the EU COPA-Cogeca Beef and Veal Group and Jacek Zarzecki, President of the Polish Association of Beef Cattle Breeders and Producers.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said the Green Deal is very ambitious and will have a major impact on farming. “It’s a top down driven plan from the EU Commission and needs detailed assessment based on facts and solid science.” </p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Leader said the EU family farm model and economic sustainability needs to be placed at the top of the Green deal agenda by both politicians and policy makers.</p>
<p>On the Green Deal and CAP, Brendan Golden said the EU Commission must learn the hard lessons from Covid-19 and recognise the importance of health, food security and food sovereignty for Europe. </p>
<p>“Never was it more important in the history of the European Union to have a strong EU and CAP Budget which underpins a strong CAP and a sustainable and resilient food supply chain based on family farms,” he said. </p>
<p>Brendan Golden farmers are the key in terms of delivering on the environment sustainability but their economic sustainability is critical. The Green Deal makes it clear that farmers earn only half of the average EU worker. He said “Farmers cannot be green if they are always in the red.”</p>
<p>On the priorities for the CAP, Brendan Golden said with the EU CAP budget negotiations concluded, the funding issues now turns to the Irish Government and the critical need for very strong co-financing. </p>
<p>“Important issues include targeted payment for vulnerable sectors like suckler cows and a payment for carbon sequestration additional to the CAP budget.” </p>
<p>He said farmers are also very concerned about eco scheme proposals in Pillar I, which involve additional environmental compliance without any additional budget.</p>

<p><strong>Cattle Price Comment</strong></p>
<p>IFA Livestock chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have risen 5-10c/kg this week driven by very tight supplies of in-spec cattle and strong market conditions. The Beef Market tracker ‘Prime Export Benchmark Price’ has increased by 5c/kg bringing the differential now to 10c/kg above the equivalent Irish price. Brendan Golden called on factories to step up to the plate and return the full value of the current market conditions to farmers.</p>
<p><strong>Lamb Price Comment</strong></p>
<p>IFA Sheep committee chairman Sean Dennehy said demand is very strong from factories for the tight supplies of lambs that are available. Deals on weights and transport are offered. Sean Dennehy said competition at mart sales between factory agents, butchers and wholesalers is intense with prices comparable to and in cases above what factories will pay. Cull ewes are making €2.80 to €3/kg. </p>

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said that while the application for PGI status for Irish beef was welcome, it must deliver a price premium for farmers. </p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said “It is farmers who have created this brand through our grass-fed animals and it is farmers that must see the return”.</p>
<p>This application was agreed following intensive discussions between IFA, the Minister and the Department of Agriculture. The process which delivered significant changes and a more farmer-centred brand, with a key aspect being a farmer-controlled monitoring group overseeing the brand.</p>
<p>He said a fundamental aspect of the agreement for the PGI application is the development of a farmer controlled suckler brand, with a budget of €6m, that will recognise the additional value in beef from suckler farms. “The Department and Bord Bia must now move immediately to develop the Suckler beef brand, to go alongside the PGI application, as agreed with IFA,” he said.</p>
<p>In addition, changes secured by IFA from the original draft included the removal of references to travel times and flexibilities on the 220 days at grass. The assessments for the meat and fat colour will only be part of the standard Bord Bia audit at factories, and will not impact on the price paid to farmers for their grass-fed product. </p>
<p>A letter requesting the EU Commission to include young bulls, if they meet the grass-fed criteria, and the issue of NI will also accompany the application.</p>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said, “This is a good outcome. The PGI will give us a chance to promote the world-renowned qualities of Irish beef while working on a brand for beef from suckler farms that promotes the quality, environmental and socio-economic benefits of this production system,” he said.</p>
<p>“We look forward to developing these brands to get increased returns for beef and suckler farmers,” he said.</p>

<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said beef prices have risen 5c-10c/kg this week, driven by very tight supplies of in-spec cattle and strong UK market conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Cattle Price Comment</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>IFA National Livestock chairman Brendan Golden said factories are actively seeking in-spec cattle for the lucrative supermarket trade in the UK with prices rising by 5-10c/kg this week. The cattle price in the UK continues to rise and with domestic supplies also projected to tighten market conditions justify better returns from factories, the UK price for R4L steers jumped 5c/kg to the vat inclusive equivalent of €4.57/kg in the past week.</p>
<p><strong>Sheep Price Comment</strong></p>
<p>IFA National Sheep committee chairman Sean Dennehy said strong market demand and tight supplies of finished lamb is driving the trade, with prices up a further 10c/kg this week. €5.50 to €5.60/kg is available from all factories at this stage with deals for larger lots and producer groups pushing past these prices. Strong competition in the mart trade is underpinning factory prices. Supplies will continue to be tight. Cull ewes are making €2.70 to €2.90/kg. Lambs should be moved as they become fit. </p>

Cattle Price Comment
IFA National Livestock chairman Brendan Golden said factories are actively seeking in-spec cattle for the lucrative supermarket trade in the UK with prices rising by 5-10c/kg this week. The cattle price in the UK continues to rise and with domestic supplies also projected to tighten market conditions justify better returns from factories, the UK price for R4L steers jumped 5c/kg to the vat inclusive equivalent of €4.57/kg in the past week.
Sheep Price Comment
IFA National Sheep committee chairman Sean Dennehy said strong market demand and tight supplies of finished lamb is driving the trade, with prices up a further 10c/kg this week. €5.50 to €5.60/kg is available from all factories at this stage with deals for larger lots and producer groups pushing past these prices. Strong competition in the mart trade is underpinning factory prices. Supplies will continue to be tight. Cull ewes are making €2.70 to €2.90/kg. Lambs should be moved as they become fit.

<p><span id=""more-25355""></span></p>
<p>“The cuts of up 20c/kg over the past week in quoted prices is not justified in the market place. While cow prices have come under pressure in some markets, it is not of the level put forward by meat factories and must be rowed back,” he said.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said market conditions are strong for in-spec cattle as the supermarket trade, which has performed strongly for beef throughout the COVID-19 restrictions, builds stocks for the lucrative Christmas trade.</p>
<p>Numbers of In-spec cattle are expected to tighten considerably over the coming weeks.  The anticipated tighter supplies of cattle in the UK should drive positive market conditions for Irish beef in our main export market.</p>
<p>Prices for steers are continuing at €3.60/kg to €3.65/kg with heifers making €3.65/kg to €3.70/kg,</p>
<p>“Factories are anxious to secure in-spec cattle and must close the gap with the UK prices to reflect the market conditions that exist. Prices in our main export market are strong and steady at the vat inclusive equivalent of €4.45/kg for R4L steers,” he said.</p>

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden has called on the Minister for Agriculture, Charlie McConalogue to provide a ‘grace’ period for farmers who have yet to meet the 50% female replacement criteria in the BDGP scheme.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said there are still a small number of farmers who have not met the 50% 4 -or 5-star female replacement criteria for the scheme. The deadline for meeting this requirement is the 31<sup>st </sup>October.</p>
<p>While recognising the efforts made by ICBF, the Department of Agriculture and all stakeholders, Brendan Golden said, “We cannot ignore the reality of what happened over the past two weeks, where the marketing of animals was disrupted at short notice. This will have contributed to some farmers not being able to meet the requirement by 31st October”.</p>
<p>Meeting with senior Department of Agriculture officials yesterday, Brendan Golden said IFA made a strong case for the provision of a ‘grace’ period for several weeks to help these farmers meet the 50% female replacement criteria.</p>
<p>He said this would not impact on the issuing of payments and is a reasonable request to facilitate farmers who had planned to purchase their 4-or 5- star animals in the past week, having received their advance basic payment on 16<sup>th</sup> October.</p>
<p>“IFA has also called for flexibility on the tolerances for meeting the 50% requirement where farmers are within one animal of meeting the 90% compliance, or full compliance with this measure. Penalties for falling below 90% compliance are severe, and recognition must be given to farmers where they are within one animal of the threshold.”</p>

IFA Seeks Change in Reference Years For Sheep Welfare Scheme Roll Over
IFA National Sheep Chairman Sean Dennehy has called on the Department of Agriculture to change the reference years of the Sheep Welfare Scheme for the CAP transition period.”The reference years do not accurately reflect the current flock of many sheep farmers within the scheme and need to be changed,” he said.
IFA Calls For Grace Period For Farmers To Meet BDGP Female Replacement Criteria And Flexibility With Tolerances
IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden has called on the Minister for Agriculture to provide a ‘Grace’ period for farmers who have yet to meet the 50% female replacement target of 4- and 5- star animals and for flexibility on the tolerances for meeting the requirement where farmers are within 1 animal of meeting the 90% compliance or full compliance with this measure.

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden has called on the meat factories to reflect the favourable market conditions in the UK in higher prices for cattle.</p>
<p>Prices in the UK continue to edge upwards and are now at the equivalent (vat incl) price of €4.47/kg for R4L steers.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said demand for beef in the UK market is strong and will improve further as stocks are built up for the lucrative Christmas trade.</p>
<p>“The higher than expected cattle kill to-date this year in the UK and the ‘lower cattle inventory’ all point towards increased demand in our primary export market for the coming months,” he said.</p>
<p>Turning to the supply situation here, Brendan Golden said most of the grass cattle have now moved through the system.  With the kill to-date up 47,000 on the same period last year, numbers are predicted to be tight for the back-end trade.</p>
<p>It’s predicted there will be 50,000 fewer cattle to kill between now and Christmas compared to last year. Exports to Northern Ireland have performed very strongly this year with numbers up almost 25,000 head on 2019 to nearly 50,000.</p>
<p>“Looking at the breakdown of overall exports, while numbers are down, the exports of finished cattle is up 16,000 head, which impacts directly on slaughter numbers for the remainder of the year,” he said.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said the demand for beef in the UK market, tight domestic supplies and tighter numbers predicted here create a positive environment for factories to maximise returns from the market place for Irish beef.</p>
<p>He said meat factories have no excuse for allowing the current price gap to continue between Irish and UK prices.</p>
<p>He said farmers should dig in on price negotiations in the knowledge numbers will be tight, and the factories need the cattle to fill the lucrative Christmas orders with the supermarkets which have seen sales of meat surge throughout the COVID-19 restrictions.</p>

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said IFA has made a formal submission to the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue in relation to marts operating under the current Level 5 restrictions.</p>
<p><span id=""more-25341""></span></p>
<p>IFA highlighted that in 2019, some 385,000 cattle were sold through Ireland’s marts in the months of October and November.</p>
<p>(See below the numbers of movements of cattle from the 2019 AIMS annual report)</p>
<p>The IFA President said this is a critical time of year for our suckler, beef and sheep farmers in the market place and it is vital that mart sales function fully over this very busy period.</p>
<p>The IFA President said the online bidding system has bedded down well in some marts as a supplementary system to a presence of buyers in the ring. However, there are huge concerns about marts operating exclusively under this system, and in particular at this time of year when throughput is at peak numbers.</p>
<p>IFA has set out the following key points in the submission to the Minister:</p>
<ul>
<li>The platforms being used to run sales have been working well, but what happened on Saturday when one of the online systems went down shows the risk of operating using this system alone.</li>
<li>The poor-quality broadband is also a contributor to the difficulties for marts and farmer buyers with an exclusive on-line sales system.</li>
<li>Not all buyers are comfortable using this system and there is a concern that they will not be active bidders. This could reduce the number of bidders and affect the integrity of the market.</li>
<li>Mart rings are generally very spacious, with high roofs and numerous openings with good airflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Against this background, IFA has again called for the facilitation of a strictly limited number of buyers around the ring, with full Government guidelines for social distancing and the wearing of masks applied.</p>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said, “We recognise this is a difficult time for all businesses. However, given the essential nature of providing an effective market outlet for cattle and sheep at this time of year, the current measures must be reviewed and a limited number of buyers allowed at the ringside to ensure sales proceed and the market functions openly and transparently,” he said.</p>
<p>He said farmers have played their part in the national efforts to-date in dealing with this pandemic and will continue to do so in a safe and responsible manner.</p>

IFA President Tim Cullinan said that the PGI will be run by a farmer-controlled monitoring committee. A letter requesting inclusion of young bulls, if they meet the grass-fed criteria, will accompany the application and also deals with the eligibility of cattle exported to NI.</br></p>
<p>€6m in funding has been committed over the next three years to develop a suckler-based brand under the control of a farmer board.<br>
The importance of building on the existing schemes to support suckler production and underpin the development of the brand was acknowledged by the Minister and the Taskforce.<br>
Brendan Golden said, “This is a good outcome. The PGI will give us a chance to promote the world-renowned qualities of Irish beef while working on a brand for beef from suckler farms that promotes the quality, environmental and socio-economic benefits of this production system”.</br></br></p>

FARMER-CONTROLLED GRASS-FED PGI AND SUCKLER-BASED BRANDS AGREED AT BEEF TASK FORCE
IFA President Tim Cullinan said that the PGI will be run by a farmer-controlled monitoring committee. A letter requesting inclusion of young bulls, if they meet the grass-fed criteria, will accompany the application and also deals with the eligibility of cattle exported to NI.
€6m in funding has been committed over the next three years to develop a suckler-based brand under the control of a farmer board.
The importance of building on the existing schemes to support suckler production and underpin the development of the brand was acknowledged by the Minister and the Taskforce.
Brendan Golden said, “This is a good outcome. The PGI will give us a chance to promote the world-renowned qualities of Irish beef while working on a brand for beef from suckler farms that promotes the quality, environmental and socio-economic benefits of this production system”.

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan has said that the Government needs to review the Level 5 operating procedures in marts as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>“The system went down in several marts this morning which caused huge issues as the cattle were already in the marts waiting to be sold,” he said.</p>
<p>“The reality is that relying on the ‘online only’ system is too ambitious. The system has been bedding down well as a complementary system to bidding at the ringside. However, clear challenges have now emerged related to broadband and the ability of systems to cope with the volume of cattle and bids during what it a hectic time of the year,” he said.</p>
<p>“Some buyers are also not yet comfortable with the online system, and farmers are concerned that the market will not function fully as these buyers will not be bidding,” he said.</p>
<p>“Everybody is doing their best, but the protocols need to be reviewed to allow a limited number of buyers around the ring,” he said.</p>
<p>“The Autumn trade is crucial, and it would be hugely disruptive if trade could not continue or if the market was compromised. I have contacted the Minister again this morning. We need to allow some level of in-person trading once social distancing and other guidelines are fully and rigorously followed,” he said.</p>

<p>Following today’s Beef Task force meeting, IFA President Tim Cullinan said that agreement had been reached to proceed with the application of PGI status for Irish Grass Fed Beef.</p>
<p><span id=""more-25331""></span></p>
<p>The PGI will now be run by a farmer-controlled monitoring committee. A letter requesting the EU Commission to include young bulls, if they meet the grass-fed criteria, will accompany the application.</p>
<p>The Department and Bord Bia have accepted that much more needs to be done to promote suckler beef.  €6m in funding has now been committed over the next three years to develop a suckler-based brand under the control of a farmer board.</p>
<p>“It is clear that something substantial needs to be done to promote suckler beef as a specialised product. In addition to the funding of €6m which was agreed today, the importance of building on the existing schemes to support suckler production and underpin the development of the brand was acknowledged by the Minister and the Taskforce,” he said.</p>
<p>In relation to the PGI application, the IFA President said the changes secured from the original draft included the removal of references to travel times and flexibilities on the 220 days at grass. In addition, assessments for the meat and fat colour will only be carried out as part of the standard Bord Bia audit at factories and will not impact on the price paid to farmers for their grass-fed product.</p>
<p>Crucially, under the revised proposals farmers will have the majority on the monitoring and oversight groups for the PGI and the new suckler based brand.</p>
<p>The issue of the eligibility of cattle exported to Northern Ireland will also be dealt with in the covering letter with the application.</p>
<p>“We have been in regular contact with our colleagues in the UFU and it is important that we don’t create any unintended barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and ourselves,” he said.</p>
<p>“I want to thank Minister McConalogue, the Department and the Chairman of the Taskforce for their efforts in resolving these matters,” he said.</p>

<p>Ahead of the plenary vote on meat and dairy denominations in the EU Parliament this week, the IFA has written to Irish MEPs urging them to accept both amendments to protect our industry and its consumers.</p>
<p>These amendments will succeed in securing words such as ‘steak’, ‘sausage’, ‘escalope’, ‘burger’ or ‘hamburger’ for products that exclusively contain meat; and ‘milk’, ‘cheese’, ‘yoghurt’, ‘butter’ or ‘whey’ for products that exclusively contain dairy.</p>
<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said, “We simply cannot have plant-based products deliberately disguised as something they are not. It’s deliberately misleading to our consumers and undermines our industry”.</p>
<p>“Private companies want to cash in on our reputation and use it to sell their products.  There is a powerful lobby in Europe to reject these amendments, so it’s crucial that our MEPs listen to farmers on the ground and adopt them,” he said.</p>

<p>Following a meeting of IFA National Council, President Tim Cullinan restated the Association’s support for a PGI application.</p>
<p><span id=""more-25290""></span></p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said IFA supports the recognition of Irish beef production through the PGI process and fully recognises the importance of having this important marketing tool for our beef.</p>
<p>“IFA supported the principle of making a PGI application at the last Taskforce meeting. However, as agreed at that meeting, issues remained to be resolved with the application. IFA has held productive talks with the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue, the Taskforce Chairman, the Department of Agriculture and Bord Bia to address these,” he said.</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said significant amendments have been made to the original application to reflect the key issues identified by IFA. These include changes to the travel times; haulage requirements; flexibilities to the 220-day requirement; and the assessment of eligibility of product.</p>
<p>However, the key issues of developing a meaningful brand for suckler beef that will be supported by the PGI application; ownership/control of these brands; and the eligibility of bulls are the outstanding issues to be resolved.</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said in developing a suckler brand, it must be under the control of farmers and must be an additional recognition above PGI status for beef produced from suckler farms. This will require dedicated funding ring-fenced in Bord Bia for the development of a brand that promotes the production systems on suckler farms recognising the societal and environmental contribution the sector makes to the country and the high-quality product that the sector produces.</p>
<p>The current €3m allocation over three years is not adequate to develop a brand of this importance to suckler farmers.  “Farmers must have control of both brands and we need to see a firm commitment from Bord Bia that funding levels will ensure the suckler brand generates real returns to suckler farmers.”</p>
<p>He said the current proposal in relation to the ‘Monitoring Group’ for the PGI is not controlled by farmers.  This is not acceptable.  The PGI is a recognition of the work we do on our farms and must remain under the control of farmers.</p>

<p>Ahead of this afternoon’s EU summit in Brussels, IFA has launched a Brexit Emergency Policy – <strong><a href=""https://ifalegacystagi.wpengine.com/BrexitPlan"">https://ifalegacystagi.wpengine.com/BrexitPlan</a></strong> – paper which sets a 3-step plan to mitigate the damage to Irish farming from Brexit.</p>
<p><span id=""more-25284""></span></p>
<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said first and foremost, “We need a deal to try and keep our exports flowing into the UK without tariffs or quotas. However, the EU Commission has to start preparing the EU market for a bad outcome. We need a clear plan from the EU on how they intend to support farmers in a no-deal scenario.”</p>
<p>“With a limited deal or a no-deal, 38% or €5.5bn worth of Irish agri-food exports to the UK are at risk. If the UK fails to agree on a trade deal, the Brexit Readiness Action Plan estimates the cost of import tariffs will be between €1.3bn and €1.5bn. This would effectively start a trade war between the EU and the UK,” he said.</p>
<p>“The recent decision by the House of Commons to reject amendments to set minimum food standards shows that the Boris Johnson Government is planning to use access to their food market as their trump card in trade negotiations with 3rd countries.

<p>“This is an unprecedented scenario, but the most comparable situation in the EU was when Russia banned all EU exports in 2014. At that time, the EU put a suite of measures in place which cost €1bn, but the impact of Brexit would have eight times that impact,” he said.</p>

<li>Step 1 looks for trade based on tariff-free and quota-free access; full recognition for the Irish protocol; and regulations at borders.</li>
<li>Step 2 calls for a suspension of imports, particularly from Mercosur; the suspension of trade negotiations on sensitive products and State Aid rules; and support for direct shipping to the EU.</li>

<p>At a meeting with the Department of Agriculture, IFA called for an early decision to allow for the extension of key farm schemes, such as GLAS and TAMS.</p>
<p>IFA Rural Development Chairman Michael Biggins said that 36,000 farmers, who are currently in GLAS 1 and 2, need certainty that their plans will be extended into 2021 and beyond if necessary, under EU CAP Transitional rules.</p>
<p>“It is vitally important that a decision to extend GLAS plans is made soon as the last thing farmers need is uncertainty and a rush to get extensions in before the end of the year,” he said.</p>
<p>The IFA Rural Development Chairman impressed upon the Department the need for a simple process to extend plans and that payment levels must be fully maintained for all farmers.</p>
<p>In relation to TAMS, the Department confirmed to IFA that Tranche 19 will close on Oct 31<sup>st</sup> and that Tranche 20 will close on Dec 31<sup>st</sup>.  The Department also confirmed to IFA that 4,688 farmers have applied under Tranche 18, which closed in August. 70% of those will shortly get an approval to proceed.</p>
<p>The IFA Rural Development Chairman pointed out that the carryover of applicants from one Tranche into another is totally unsatisfactory and he called on the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue to sort this out.</p>
<p>“Like GLAS, an early decision on an extension to TAMS is now important as the investment plans of farmers must not be put on hold pending a new investment scheme in the next CAP.  IFA is seeking an additional allocation of €38m in next week’s Budget, to bring the total allocation for TAMS to €120m,” he said.</p>
<p>The Department pointed out, that so far this year, they have spent €54.8m out of a total allocation of €82.5m.  IFA is encouraging farmers to make their payment claim as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The decision by the European Commission to prolong anti-dumping measures on Ammonium Nitrate from Russia for another five years is a further blow to European agriculture as Irish farmers will continue to face high-priced nitrogen fertiliser prices in a market devoid of fair competition.</p>
<p>“It is incredible that a measure introduced in 1995 will now be extended to 2025 in order to assure and protect the profitability of European fertiliser producers while farmers face further decline in income due to higher costs. We believe that if this proposal is unchanged that the extension of the anti-dumping measure will cost European farmers up to €3bn in additional costs (AN and CAN fertiliser).” He said.</p>
<p>“The case put forward by the Commission was full of conjecture and referred to a possible threat of dumping on the European market, with product ‘likely to spill over to the Union market’ but with no concrete evidence.”</p>
<p>Anti-dumping duties are an additional cost charged to companies trying to export product into the European Union where it is decided  by the Commission that the price is below cost and dumping is taking place; on top of a customs duty of 6.5% and transport costs, Ammonium Nitrate from Russia is charged an additional €32.71/tonne and as a result this product is not competitive; does not enter the market in significant quantities; and European manufacturers have a closed and protected market to themselves.</p>
<p>The Commission indicated that it was difficult to assess the precise cost of Ammonium Nitrate for all farms and it was regrettable that due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Commission case team were not in a position to visit the farms of the French farmers who had offered to show the impact first hand of high fertiliser costs on their farms.</p>
<p>“We are paying over the odds for fertiliser in Ireland and Europe and even when natural gas costs decrease, the Commission believes a time lag of five months is acceptable before fertiliser prices show a decrease. Since June 2019, gas prices have declined by 66% but Ammonium Nitrate prices have only fallen 19%.”</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said, “the Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski has not replied to my letter sent to him in July on this matter.  We need to see him come out and defend farmers’ livelihoods by demanding a fairer market for fertiliser inputs. This decision achieves just the opposite”.</p>
<p>IFA will be lodging a reply ahead of Monday’s deadline.</p>

“We are paying over the odds for fertiliser in Ireland and Europe and even when natural gas costs decrease, the Commission believes a time lag of five months is acceptable before fertiliser prices show a decrease. Since June 2019, gas prices have declined by 66% but Ammonium Nitrate prices have only fallen 19%.”
Tim Cullinan said, “the Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski has not replied to my letter sent to him in July on this matter.  We need to see him come out and defend farmers’ livelihoods by demanding a fairer market for fertiliser inputs. This decision achieves just the opposite”.
IFA will be lodging a reply ahead of Monday’s deadline.

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said that the fact that Bord Bia are now scrambling to spin aspects of their PGI document is a direct result of their failure to discuss the document with farmers before it was published.</p>
<p><span id=""more-25108""></span></p>
<p>“Farmers should read the full document rather than the spin from Bord Bia,” he said.</p>
<p>It was very clear that there was considerable farmer disquiet over Bord Bia’s direction of travel in relation to the PGI and this was further emphasised at the most recent meeting of the Beef Taskforce.</p>
<p>This was even before Bord Bia decided to include a number of aspects in the application which were not discussed with anybody.</p>
<p>Their statement that commitments that all animals, including young bulls, would be eligible for the grass-fed ‘standard’ did not mean they would be eligible for the grass-fed ‘PGI’ is disingenuous and inconsistent.</p>
<p>The key issue here is to ensure that farmers see a return from a grass fed PGI. Remarkably, Bord Bia themselves stated in media interviews that they have no market research to suggest that farmers can get a premium for a grass-fed beef PGI.</p>
<p>Now they are trying to rely on general statements about other PGIs which were put in place to protect brands that were already gaining a premium before they were protected.</p>
<p>This whole concept needs a fundamental re-think and Bord Bia need to realise that without farmers there is no food industry</p>
<p>“We will be seeking to meet with the new Minister to discuss this issue once they are appointed this week,” the IFA leader said,</p>
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said that in relation to animal transport, the document clearly refers to all farmers being within two hours of abattoirs. Bord Bia have decided to make a virtue of this in the application, yet we are told it won’t be a requirement. This is not credible. There should be no reference to travel times anywhere in a document like this.</p>
<p>“In addition, they state that animals travel to abattoirs with registered hauliers. What lorry an animal is transported in has nothing do with being grass fed,” he said.</p>
<p>“Bord Bia say they have not finalised the meat colour chart. Yet the document contains a sample colour chart for assessing the ‘cherry redness’ and ‘creaminess’ of the meat.

IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden has advised farmers to bargain hard when selling cattle.

“The market is strong and demand is good, with agents actively seeking animals. €3.65/€3.70 is being paid out and farmers should continue to fight hard for price,” he said.
Brendan Golden said UK prices have increased slightly this week and there is good demand in both Northern Ireland and the UK.
Trade in marts is very positive and weanling sales are off to a good start.
The Livestock Chairman also reminded farmers who qualify for the Beef Finisher Payment scheme to apply.
“We want the €50m out to farmers as quickly as possible. The closing date is Sept 9th and I would encourage farmers to get their applications in promptly. All the details are available at ifalegacystagi.wpengine.com/beef-finisher-scheme,” he said.

<p><span id=""more-25071""></span></p>
<p>“They failed to act on hundreds of complaints from farmers, but sprang into action as soon as Meat Industry Ireland wrote to them,” he said.</p>
<p>“It is extraordinary that despite what was going on at the time, and the volume of complaints made to the CCPC, they refused to use their considerable powers to carry out any type of investigative work to seek evidence of collusion,” he said.</p>
<p>“In fact, the CCPC only responded to farmer complaints when the IFA legal team wrote to them threatening legal action due to their failure to carry out their functions,” he said.</p>
<p>“Out of frustration, IFA recently took out public advertisements seeking evidence of collusion between processors,” he said.</p>

<p>“It seems the CCPC is only interested in keeping prices to consumers low, and is ignoring their remit to enforce fair competition along the chain,” he said.</p>

<p>“The focus on keeping consumer prices down is putting undue pressure on all parts of the food chain. We need a totally new approach on food. The Government must move to set up the office of the Food Ombudsman as committed to in the Programme for Government. We need to focus on fairness throughout the chain, rather than on a narrow cheap food agenda,” he said.</p>

“In fact, the CCPC only responded to farmer complaints when the IFA legal team wrote to them threatening legal action due to their failure to carry out their functions,” he said.
“Out of frustration, IFA recently took out public advertisements seeking evidence of collusion between processors,” he said.
 
“It seems the CCPC is only interested in keeping prices to consumers low, and is ignoring their remit to enforce fair competition along the chain,” he said.
 
“The focus on keeping consumer prices down is putting undue pressure on all parts of the food chain. We need a totally new approach on food. The Government must move to set up the office of the Food Ombudsman as committed to in the Programme for Government. We need to focus on fairness throughout the chain, rather than on a narrow cheap food agenda,” he said.

<p><strong>CAP/MFF Outcome</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>EU heads of state, including Taoiseach Michael Martin agreed an EU Budget for the next 7 years (2021 to 2027) in Brussels earlier this week. As well as a recovery package for the EU in response to the Covid-19 crisis, this plan also agreed the CAP Budget and a Brexit Adjustment Reserve of €5bn. The overall value of the Package was €1.8 trillion.</li>
<li>The final outcome is slightly better than the original Commission proposals At constant prices (adjusted for inflation) the CAP Budget was reduced from €382.8bn in 2014/2020 period to €243.9bn in 2021/2027 period, a reduction of 10.1%. In current prices (excluding inflation) the CAP Budget was maintained or slightly increased.</li>
<li>While the detailed breakdown of the CAP Budget figures for each individual country have yet to be provided by the Commission, the Taoiseach outlined to the Dail that the CAP Budget for Ireland had increased by €50m from €10.68bn (2014-2020) to €10.73bn (2021-2027) at current prices. However, Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary has indicated that the reduced budget will lead to a 3% reduction in BPS (Basic payment Scheme) payments from 2021 onwards.</li>
<li>Member states have the opportunity of increasing the level of National co-financing under CAP Pillar II measures. The level of co-financing is a national decision and has been set at a standard 43% EU and 57% national funding. This is a major change compared to the last CAP programming period, when in Irelands case the level of co-financing was 54% EU and 46% national.</li>
<li>If the Irish Government co-finance at the national rate of 57%, it could leave a 7-year RDP worth €5.241bn (2021-2027) compared to €4.1bn in the last period (2014-2020).</li>
<li>The debate will now move quickly to the level of National co-financing the Irish Government is prepared to provide, which will be critical in terms of financing future farm schemes and farm incomes.</li>
<li>IFA has set a target that Direct Payments (both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2), should increase from the current annual level of €1.8bn to €2bn in the next CAP post 2020.</li>

€50m Beef Finishers Pandemic Payment

IFA has made a detailed submission to the Department of Agriculture on the allocation of the €50m Beef Finishers Scheme, secured by the Association following an intensive lobby from April to June.
IFA is clear that the payment should be €100 per animal and targeted to beef finishers that incurred the highest losses in terms of price cuts/market disturbance and the highest feeding costs.
The President met with the new Minister for Agriculture Dara Calleary this week and reiterated the IFA position along with discussing key issues on CAP, Brexit, Climate, Food Ombudsman and more. IFA also lobbied Government TDs on the issue this week.

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said the change by Bord Bia to include young bulls in its grass fed standard is the right thing to do for farmers.</p>
<p>Following consultation with the IFA over recent weeks, Tim Cullinan said Bord Bia has now agreed to the following changes to the grass fed standard;</p>
<ul>
<li>To adapt the scope of the grass fed standard to accommodate young bull beef. This change means young bull beef will now be eligible to be included in the grass fed standard, along with steers, heifers and cows.</li>
<li>To provide that the first nine months of an animal’s life (including young bulls) will be deemed as grass fed regardless of whether they were on QA (Quality Assured) or non-QA farm(s).</li>
<li>To treat young bulls the same as other animal categories with their qualification as grass fed being dependent on meeting the criteria of the standard concerning the proportion of grass in the diet and grazing days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tim Cullinan said IFA could never agree to the exclusion of young bull beef from the grass fed standard and insisted that this category of animal was treated along similar lines to all other types.</p>
<p>“I want to acknowledge the fact that Bord Bia has listened to reason on this matter and adopted a flexible approach in order that to maximise the proportion of beef that will qualify as grass fed”.</p>
<p>“Not all young bull beef systems will fit into the grass fed standard, but if farmers operate their system to meet the criteria, they will now be able to qualify,” he said.</p>
<p>“These changes apply to the Bord Bia Grass fed standard. Bord Bia had originally intended this to be the basis for Protected Geographical Indicator (PGI) application. However, this needs far more discussion before it proceeds any further,” he said.</p>

<p><strong>Cattle Prices, EU Meat market Observatory, Beef Taskforce and Lamb Prices.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cattle Prices need to rise. </strong>IFA said this week farmers selling finished cattle should demand higher beef prices as all the market factors show the factories can pay more. Prices in our main export market in the UK have increased by 44c/kg since April 25<sup>th</sup>, while Irish prices have only risen by 22c/kg. AHBD report that UK cattle prices continue to rise strongly up another 2.3p/kg for week ended June 20<sup>th</sup>.  The UK steer price is at £3.68/kg, equivalent to €4.29/kg incl vat.  This is 48c/kg above the Irish price, which amounts to a price differential of €173 on an average steer. Cattle price across the main EU markets are also recovering with retail sales continue to show very strong growth and food service coming back as the Covid restrictions are eased.  Factories agents and procurement managers are very active buying finished cattle in the marts and on line and paying prices that are significantly above their quoted prices. In addition, Northern Ireland  factories are very active, paying prices from 10 to 20c/kg above Irish prices. The Northern Ireland LMC report that 785 cattle were exported live from the Republic to Northern Ireland for slaughter in the week to June 20 The R3 steer price in Northern Ireland was £3.61/kg, which is equivalent to €4.20/kg.  Department of Agriculture AIMs data on future cattle supplies shows that on May 1<sup>st</sup> there was a reduction of 83,000 in the number of beef cattle in the 12-24-month category and 10,000 in the 24-36 month category compared to 2019, meaning that supplies over the next number of months will remain much tighter than 2019 levels. Retail consumption figures for Ireland continue to show very strong growth on beef sales, up 17.4% for the last 12 weeks to May 17<sup>th</sup>., compared to 2019 levels. In the UK, retail data shows beef volume sales up 22.4% and value sales up 23.1%, for the 12-week period to May 17<sup>th</sup> compared to 2019, with stake sales up 24% and mince up 36%.</li>

<li><strong>EU Meat Market Observatory. </strong>IFA participated in the EU Commission Meat Market Observatory meeting in Brussels this week, where the Commission said the beef market is recovering slowly from Covid and prices are rising in most member states. EU exports are down 8% for the Jan-Arp period but imports are down 22%. IFA highlighted the major inadequacies in beef market supports in the CAP policy for a crisis like Covid and the ongoing uncertainties from Brexit. In a discussion on Farm to Fork, IFA highlighted the importance of a profitable and sustainable beef sector for rural areas and communities, land use and integration with other sectors like dairy.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beef Taskforce. </strong>IFA attended a Beef Taskforce meeting this week and called on the processors to increase prices in line with increased market returns. IFA pointed out cattle prices in our main export market in the UK have increased by 40c/kg since April 25<sup>th</sup>, while Irish prices have only risen by 22c/kg. IFA questioned consultants Grant Thornton on the investigation into the supply chain and insisted that the Minister must tell the beef factories and the retailers to co-operate fully and provide all the required price and margin information for this important investigation. IFA also raised issues on the Bord Bia Grass fed and PGI proposals around the lack of proper consultation with farmers and the need for more engagement.</li>

Cattle Prices, EU Meat market Observatory, Beef Taskforce and Lamb Prices. 

Cattle Prices need to rise. IFA said this week farmers selling finished cattle should demand higher beef prices as all the market factors show the factories can pay more. Prices in our main export market in the UK have increased by 44c/kg since April 25th, while Irish prices have only risen by 22c/kg. AHBD report that UK cattle prices continue to rise strongly up another 2.3p/kg for week ended June 20th.  The UK steer price is at £3.68/kg, equivalent to €4.29/kg incl vat.  This is 48c/kg above the Irish price, which amounts to a price differential of €173 on an average steer. Cattle price across the main EU markets are also recovering with retail sales continue to show very strong growth and food service coming back as the Covid restrictions are eased.  Factories agents and procurement managers are very active buying finished cattle in the marts and on line and paying prices that are significantly above their quoted prices.

<p><strong>New €50m Beef Finishers Scheme </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Following an intensive campaign over recent weeks, <strong>IFA has secured funding of €50m for a new Beef Finishers Scheme</strong> in response to the COVID-19 and other market disturbances.</li>
<li>IFA welcomed the scheme, which was announced by the Minister for Agriculture on Friday June 12<sup>th</sup>.</li>
<li>Beef finishers have incurred significant beef price losses from COVID -19 and other market disturbances this spring resulting in severe economic impact on their farm enterprises and family farm income.</li>
<li>IFA has held a number of meetings with the Department of Agriculture on the support package and made a <strong>detailed submission</strong> on proposals for the scheme this week.</li>
<li>The IFA made a number of important points in respect of the scheme including;</li>
<li>The scheme must be <strong>for cattle finishers and payment targeted at finishers</strong> who incurred the most financial losses.</li>
<li><strong>All finished cattle</strong> should be covered in the scheme including steers, heifers, young bulls and cows, with the exception of cows with conformation score P and fat score 1 and calves. The Minister has made it clear factory owned and dealer owned cattle will not be covered.</li>
<li>The payment rate must be a <strong>minimum of €100 per finished animal.</strong></li>
<li>Payments should apply to finished animals <strong>retrospectively </strong>from the announcement date by the Minister in order to prevent factories using the support in an anticompetitive way to manipulate prices on cattle going forward.</li>
<li>There should be <strong>no restrictive limit</strong> on the number of eligible animals per farm which qualify.</li>
<li>The terms and conditions of the scheme must <strong>be simple and farmer friendly</strong>.</li>
<li>There can be <strong>no conditionality</strong> attached to the scheme.</li>
<li>The full funding of €50m must be utilised and paid out under the scheme. The terms and conditions must be structured a way to ensure the total funding amount of €50million is paid out to farmers and none of the funds are left unused.</li>
<li>The application process should be simple and <strong>opened for farmers to apply immediately.</strong></li>
<li>Payment should be made to all eligible applicants on or <strong>before the end of August</strong>, so as to ease the severe financial difficulties on finishing farms and also assist the weanling and store cattle trade in the second half of the year.</li>
<li>The payment should apply to all finished <strong>cattle sold in the marts</strong>, provided those cattle were slaughtered within 30 days of purchase. The payment should go to the farmer who sold the animal regardless of who purchased the animals in the mart.</li>
<li>The payment should apply to finished <strong>cattle exported live to Northern Ireland</strong>.</li>
<li>The payment should apply to finished <strong>cattle exported live to international markets.</strong></li>
<li>It should be structured in such a way under EU state aids approval under the COVID-19 Temporary State Aid Framework so as to ensure all cattle finishers that apply get paid on all eligible cattle.</li>
<li>The scheme should positively accommodate <strong>farm partnerships</strong> and not in any way discriminate against individual farmer members in partnerships.</li>
<li>IFA is available for further consultation with the Department of Agriculture on the scheme.</li>

New €50m Beef Finishers Scheme  

Following an intensive campaign over recent weeks, IFA has secured funding of €50m for a new Beef Finishers Scheme in response to the COVID-19 and other market disturbances.
IFA welcomed the scheme, which was announced by the Minister for Agriculture on Friday June 12th.
Beef finishers have incurred significant beef price losses from COVID -19 and other market disturbances this spring resulting in severe economic impact on their farm enterprises and family farm income.
IFA has held a number of meetings with the Department of Agriculture on the support package and made a detailed submission on proposals for the scheme this week.
The IFA made a number of important points in respect of the scheme including;
The scheme must be for cattle finishers and payment targeted at finishers who incurred the most financial losses.
All finished cattle should be covered in the scheme including steers, heifers, young bulls and cows, with the exception of cows with conformation score P and fat score 1 and calves. The Minister has made it clear factory owned and dealer owned cattle will not be covered.
The payment rate must be a minimum of €100 per finished animal.
Payments should apply to finished animals retrospectively from the announcement date by the Minister in order to prevent factories using the support in an anticompetitive way to manipulate prices on cattle going forward.
There should be no restrictive limit on the number of eligible animals per farm which qualify.
The terms and conditions of the scheme must be simple and farmer friendly.
There can be no conditionality attached to the scheme.
The full funding of €50m must be utilised and paid out under the scheme. The terms and conditions must be structured a way to ensure the total funding amount of €50million is paid out to farmers and none of the funds are left unused.
The application process should be simple and opened for farmers to apply immediately.
Payment should be made to all eligible applicants on or before the end of August, so as to ease the severe financial difficulties on finishing farms and also assist the weanling and store cattle trade in the second half of the year.
The payment should apply to all finished cattle sold in the marts, provided those cattle were slaughtered within 30 days of purchase. The payment should go to the farmer who sold the animal regardless of who purchased the animals in the mart.
The payment should apply to finished cattle exported live to Northern Ireland.
The payment should apply to finished cattle exported live to international markets.
It should be structured in such a way under EU state aids approval under the COVID-19 Temporary State Aid Framework so as to ensure all cattle finishers that apply get paid on all eligible cattle.
The scheme should positively accommodate farm partnerships and not in any way discriminate against individual farmer members in partnerships.
IFA is available for further consultation with the Department of Agriculture on the scheme.

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said farmers selling finished cattle should demand higher beef prices as all the market factors show the factories can pay more.</p>
<p><span id=""more-21679""></span></p>
<p>Brendan Golden said cattle prices in our main export market in the UK have increased by 40c/kg since April 25<sup>th</sup>, while Irish prices have only risen by 22c/kg.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The beef market in the UK, where we export most of our beef, is rising rapidly week on week while our prices are struggling to move on.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>AHBD report that UK cattle prices continue to rise strongly up another 5.5p/kg for week ended June 13<sup>th</sup>.  The UK steer price is at £3.65/kg, equivalent to €4.27/kg incl vat.  This is 46c/kg above the Irish price, which amounts to €165 on an average steer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Brendan Golden also pointed out that cattle price across the main EU markets are also recovering with retail sales continue to show very strong growth and food service coming back as the COVID-19 restrictions are eased.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Factories agents and procurement managers are very active buying finished cattle in the marts and online, and paying prices that are significantly above their quoted prices. In addition, Northern factories are very active, paying prices from 10 to 20c/kg above Irish prices.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Northern Ireland LMC report that 791 cattle were exported live from the Republic to Northern Ireland for slaughter in the week to June 13<sup>th</sup> and the R3 steer price in Northern Ireland was £3.59, which is equivalent to €4.18/kg.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The IFA Livestock leader pointed out that the Department of Agriculture AIMs data on future cattle supplies shows that on April 1<sup>st</sup> there was a reduction of 103,000 in the number of beef cattle in the 12-24 month category, meaning that supplies over the next number of months will remain much tighter than 2019 levels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Retail consumption figures for Ireland continue to show very strong growth on beef sales, up 17.4% for the last 12 weeks, compared to 2019 levels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the UK, retail data shows beef volume sales up 22.4% and value sales up 23.1%, for the 12-week period to May 17<sup>th</sup> compared to 2019.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Brendan Golden said figures produced by retail representatives at the EU Meat Market Observatory meeting attended by IFA in Brussels earlier this week show similar positive retail consumption trends across the main EU markets.</p>

“Factories agents and procurement managers are very active buying finished cattle in the marts and online, and paying prices that are significantly above their quoted prices. In addition, Northern factories are very active, paying prices from 10 to 20c/kg above Irish prices.”
 
The Northern Ireland LMC report that 791 cattle were exported live from the Republic to Northern Ireland for slaughter in the week to June 13th and the R3 steer price in Northern Ireland was £3.59, which is equivalent to €4.18/kg.
 
The IFA Livestock leader pointed out that the Department of Agriculture AIMs data on future cattle supplies shows that on April 1st there was a reduction of 103,000 in the number of beef cattle in the 12-24 month category, meaning that supplies over the next number of months will remain much tighter than 2019 levels.
 
Retail consumption figures for Ireland continue to show very strong growth on beef sales, up 17.4% for the last 12 weeks, compared to 2019 levels.
 
In the UK, retail data shows beef volume sales up 22.4% and value sales up 23.1%, for the 12-week period to May 17th compared to 2019.
 
Brendan Golden said figures produced by retail representatives at the EU Meat Market Observatory meeting attended by IFA in Brussels earlier this week show similar positive retail consumption trends across the main EU markets.

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said that Bord Bia must revisit its grass-fed standard, especially the exclusion of all young bulls from eligibility.</p>
<p>“It is wrong that two animals who may spend the same number of days at grass and consume the same grass-fed diet are treated differently. The same criteria should apply to every animal,” he said.</p>
<p>“Not all young bull systems will fit into the standard, but if they do, or if a farmer wants to adjust their systems to fit into the criteria, they should be allowed to do so,” he said.</p>
<p>“There are several aspects of this application which need further clarification. Farmers pay €6m a year to Bord Bia. We are the ones who are creating this brand for the industry through our grass-fed animals, but we have not been properly consulted”.</p>
<p>“Bord Bia’s application referred to Teagasc’s involvement in developing the criteria. I am astonished that Teagasc has apparently supported the total exclusion of all young bulls – even if they meet the standard,” said the IFA President.</p>
<p>“I think Teagasc need to clarify their role in this process,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>PGI</strong></p>
<p>On PGI, Tim Cullinan said, “We need to separate the discussion on the details around a grass-fed standard from the possibility of applying for Protected Geographic Indication (PGI) status for Irish beef. There are fundamental questions we need to ask about what exact brand we should seek to protect and who owns that brand”.</p>
<p>“I think we should look at farmers owning any PGI brand before we hand it over to the processors or retailers to exploit without any guarantee of a price premium for farmers. While we understand the challenge in getting approval for any EU application for PGI status there is no point in getting approval if it doesn’t deliver a real benefit for farmers,” he said.</p>

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan has welcomed the announcement by the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Agriculture Minister Michael Creed of a €50m direct payment package for beef farmers to cover price losses incurred as a result of the collapse in the market due to COVID-19 and other factors, including Brexit.</p>
<p><span id=""more-21621""></span></p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said, “The details of the scheme and the small print will be very important. IFA is set to meet with the Department of Agriculture next Monday to progress the scheme details further”.</p>
<p>“IFA made detailed submissions to Government outlining the strong case for a direct payment support package and our officers around the country have worked hard lobbying politicians,” he said.</p>
<p>“This new package, along with the recent €35m BEEP-S scheme secured for suckler cows is badly needed.”</p>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden also welcomed the beef package, saying finishers had taken a severe financial hit this spring. He said the COVID-19 crisis has impacted significantly on markets, especially the food service sector, which was closed down.</p>
<p>“As a major beef exporter, Ireland was hit much harder than many other countries.”</p>

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said that Bord Bia’s proposal on a new ‘grass-fed standard’ and their proposed criteria for Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status for ‘Irish Grass-Fed Beef’ needs a lot more thought and discussion before they are proceeded with.</p>
<p><span id=""more-21588""></span></p>
<p>“Ireland is well recognised on the international market for being a grass-fed country. This Bord Bia proposal is complicated and it runs the risk of devaluing and excluding some Irish beef that may not meet the technical specifications,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’d like to see clear market research carried out by Bord Bia to show that putting these criteria in place will give a higher price return to farmers,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The issue of the grass-fed standard came up at the Bord Bia board meeting yesterday. I made it clear that it needed far more clarity and discussion before Bord Bia can proceed,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It runs the risk of creating more bureaucracy for farmers and it is unclear who will be the final arbiter on whether or not an animal qualifies,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It is wrong that all bulls are being deemed ineligible for the grass-fed standard even if they can meet the criteria. There needs to be more clarity on how the criteria are being applied and calculated,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Bull beef is the most efficient production system for many farmers. Some factories have been discouraging it, but we need a full debate on this before Bord Bia ends up to ghettoising bull beef,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We also need a fundamental debate on the benefits of the PGI status and what categories of beef this should be applied for,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said neither the National Livestock Committee nor our National Council has had a chance to discuss this as we did not have the full details. More time is needed to properly consult farmers, examine all the detail and discuss it in full,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Beef farmers are crying out for clear direction on beef marketing and branding, that will deliver a viable price return. Exploiting our grass-fed image more could be of real value, but farmers experience to date is that complying with standards has being used negatively rather than positively in terms of a higher beef price. We need to get this right and farmers need to be centrally involved,” he said.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>IFA Farm Forestry Chairman Vincent Nally is asking everybody to be vigilant over the Bank Holiday weekend after a Condition Red – High Fire Risk has issued.</p>
<p><span id=""more-21589""></span></p>
<p>He cautioned farmers to be extra vigilant.  Some have already suffered financial losses.  After such a prolonged spell of dry weather, a wildfire risk can quickly develop in areas where flammable vegetation such as grasses, gorse, and heather are present.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Vincent Nally said recreational users who are within 5km of a forest will be out this weekend. Sometimes a fire can be started inadvertently.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Most fires spread from adjoining land into the forest.  It’s important that farmers assess the risk to their forest and make sure that their firebreaks are maintained.  A firebreak should consist of a six-metre-wide fuel free zone, typically around the boundary of the forest,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He encouraged farmers to review their fire plan for their forest, or to prepare a fire plan, especially if your forest is located in a high-risk area.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He said the plan should identify and map the risks and the likely outcomes if there was a fire, assembly points, access and escape routes, reservoirs or water points and firebreaks. The plan should also contain the number for the local fire station, local Garda station, Registered Forester etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Forest fires have caused significant financial losses for farmers in recent years, with years of growth and timber production lost in a single incident. It’s so important that farmers consider the financial consequences of a fire and make sure there they have adequate insurance cover as under the Afforestation scheme farmers are obligated to replant when a forest is damaged by fire.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He said that if you see a fire, do not delay, report it to the Fire and Emergency Services by calling 999 or 112. He stressed that you will not be billed by the Fire Service or Local Authority for making the call.</p>

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-welcome-return-of-marts-and-encourage-strong-farmer-support/,IFA Welcome Return of Marts and Encourage Strong Farmer Support,20 July 2020,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan has welcomed the resumption of auction rings at the marts from next week under the new Department of Agriculture ‘safe sale’ conditions and protocols.</p>
<p>He said while the protocols are detailed and restrictive in order to protect people, it’s a significant step towards getting this essential service back up and operating again.</p>
<p>The IFA President strongly encouraged farmers to support their local mart.</p>
<p>“Marts provide an essential service to farmers and the agricultural community in terms of the livestock trade. They provide open and transparent market price competition and security of payment,” he said.</p>
<p>“While online trading has been a great help and is certainly part of the future for marts, the closure and restrictions on the trade this spring have hit the livestock sector, marts and farmers. The spring is peak trading season for cattle and a lot of this trade has been lost.”</p>
<p>IFA commends the efforts of the marts and their representative bodies to re-open the services as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“It is essential we have a strong mart service for the summer and autumn periods.”</p>
<p>“Discussions have taken place with the Department of Agriculture and detailed protocols and procedures have been worked out, which hopefully will facilitate a smooth return towards a more normal service from next week,” he said.</p>
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the marts, as an essential service provider, have a very strong case to make to Government for assistance due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>He said, “IFA strongly supports the case for an amnesty on rates; Government assistance with insurance costs; grant aid for investment in IT; and online technology trading developments in the marts”.</p>

He said while the protocols are detailed and restrictive in order to protect people, it’s a significant step towards getting this essential service back up and operating again.
The IFA President strongly encouraged farmers to support their local mart.
“Marts provide an essential service to farmers and the agricultural community in terms of the livestock trade. They provide open and transparent market price competition and security of payment,” he said.
“While online trading has been a great help and is certainly part of the future for marts, the closure and restrictions on the trade this spring have hit the livestock sector, marts and farmers. The spring is peak trading season for cattle and a lot of this trade has been lost.”
IFA commends the efforts of the marts and their representative bodies to re-open the services as soon as possible.
“It is essential we have a strong mart service for the summer and autumn periods.”
“Discussions have taken place with the Department of Agriculture and detailed protocols and procedures have been worked out, which hopefully will facilitate a smooth return towards a more normal service from next week,” he said.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the marts, as an essential service provider, have a very strong case to make to Government for assistance due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
He said, “IFA strongly supports the case for an amnesty on rates; Government assistance with insurance costs; grant aid for investment in IT; and online technology trading developments in the marts”.

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said there was no basis for pressure on cattle prices from the factories. “Prices are rising strongly in our main export market in the UK and also across EU markets and the food service sector is coming back as the economy reopens,” he said.</p>
<p><span id=""more-21604""></span></p>
<p>Brendan Golden said there was no basis for factories to try to lower quoted beef prices as all of the market facts were pointing in the opposite more positive direction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beef prices in the UK, our major export market, has increased by 15p/kg in the last two weeks to May 30th, with steer prices now reported at £3.51/kg, which is equivalent to €4.16/kg incl vat. This is some 35c/kg (€126 per head) over R3 Irish prices at €3.81/kg for the same week.</li>
<li>EU prime cattle prices have also risen strongly in the last two weeks with young bull prices up 7c/kg and heifer prices up 6c/kg to May 31<sup>st</sup>.</li>
<li>The latest DAFM AIMs data on future cattle supplies shows that on April 1<sup>st</sup> there was a reduction of 103,000 in the number of beef cattle in the 12 to 24-month category, meaning that supplies over the next number of weeks and months will remain much tighter than 2019 levels.</li>
<li>The latest retail consumption figures for Ireland from Kanter show continued and very strong growth on beef sales, up 17.4% for the last 12 weeks, compared to 2019 levels. In the UK, AHDB retail data shows beef volume sales up 17.7% and value sales up 19.4%, compared to 2019.</li>
<li>Cow prices in the UK have risen rapidly over the last three weeks to May 31<sup>st</sup>., up 26p/kg with O+3 grade cows making £2.79/kg, equivalent to €3.30/kg incl vat and reflecting the extremely strong manufacturing demand and burger trade.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Brendan Golden said some factories are incorrectly using the excuse of the temporary closure of China as a means for price pressure. However, the Minister and Department of Agriculture has made it clear that this is only a technicality and the market will re-open soon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The IFA National Livestock Leader said farmers should dig in hard with the meat plants and insist on more than the quoted price.  This is well justified by the stronger market returns over the last number of weeks.</p>

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said the suspension of access to the Chinese market was disappointing and that it must be resolved quickly.</p>
<p><span id=""more-21584""></span></p>
<p>“This is a technical issue resulting from the discovery of a case of A-Typical BSE in a 14-year old cow in this country. Under the protocol, Ireland is required to submit a detailed epidemiological report,” he said.</p>

<p>“The Chinese market took 10,000 tonnes of Irish beef last year and 2,900 tonnes had gone there in the first quarter of 2020.

<p><strong>Beef</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Latest Beef price update 21/5/2020. Steer base price €3.60/kg. Heifers €3.60/3.70. Young bull’s R/O €3.60/3.70. Cows P/O/R/U €2.90/€3.00/€3.20/kg.</li>
<li>Cattle prices continue to strengthen driven by tighter supplies and strong retail demand. Factories chasing tight supplies, offering deals which include the full cost of transport, removal of weight restrictions and additional price top ups. The supply balance has swung in favour of the farmer.</li>
<li><strong>Supplies</strong>. Supplies totalled 26,911 for week ending May 17<sup>th</sup>., down about 5,900 on the same week last year. Kill to date down 31,683 on 2019 levels. Y Bulls are back 30k, steers are up +10k, heifers are down -6k and cows are back -15k. However, when calves are removed, the overall adult kill is back closer to 46,000 head.</li>
<li>Numbers over the coming weeks expected to remain tight until the first of the grass cattle set to arrive.</li>
<li><strong>Official Prices. </strong>DAFM reported Irish R3 steer prices for w/e May 10<sup>th</sup> was €3.67/kg incl vat. Heifers R3 €3.70/kg. Y Bulls O/R/U €3.33/€3.52/€3.61/kg. Cows P/O/R €2.72/€2.80/€2.99/kg.</li>
<li><strong>UK cattle prices</strong> for w/e May 17<sup>th</sup>. AHBD report a 6p/kg rise in prices. R3 steers at £3.36/kg, equivalent to €3.96/kg incl vat. Heifers were up 6.4p/kg, Young bulls were up 5.4p/kg and cows were up 8.7p/kg, with -O4L at £2.43/kg equivalent to €2.86/kg.</li>
<li><strong>Official cattle prices reported to the EU Commission</strong> on May 1`7th 2020. R3 Young Bulls c/kg excl vat; EU Average €3.42/kg, Germany €3.37/kg, France €3.63/kg, Spain €3.46/kg, Austria €3.45/kg Italy €3.84/kg Poland €2.68/kg. Steer Prices; Ireland €3.55/kg, UK €3.80/kg.</li>
<li><strong>EU Young bull prices</strong> are up 1.86/kg on the week and EU steers are up 4.78/kg on the previous week, with cows up 1.00c/kg and heifers up 4.49c/kg.</li>
<li>The resumption of some <strong>manufacturing plants</strong> and some reopening of food service at EU level has helped the trade. The reopening of McDonalds and Supermacs drive-through helped the cow trade.</li>
<li><strong>APS</strong>. Irish processors applied for only 20 tonnes of <strong>APS</strong>. Total applications across the EU of 706 tonnes with 400t from Poland, 230t from Holland, 46t from Spain and 10t from Austria.</li>
<li><strong>Live Exports.</strong> 4,648 cattle were exported in the week commencing 04/5/2020, 3,822 to EU (Except NI). Live exports for 2020 amount to 144,977 compared to 186,276 in 2019.</li>
<li><strong>Calf exports</strong> of 112,383 year to date.</li>
<li>There were considerable difficulties with the <strong>Algerian live export</strong> trade over recent weeks, involving loading delays, payment difficulties and delays on the first shipment. IFA assisted up to about 15 farmers getting paid in full.</li>
<li>When the boat, the MV Sarah returned for the second shipment, difficulties occurred between the exporter and the DAFM on horned cattle, individual weighing and withdrawal periods on medications.</li>
<li>Working with the exporter and the DAFM, IFA asked Minister Creed to intervene directly, which he did and all of these issues were subsequently resolved but shipments were delayed and along with TB difficulties on some farms the exporter was unable to proceed and cancelled the shipment. The livestock carrier has left Ireland empty.</li>
<li>IFA Payment Policy. <strong>Insist </strong><strong>on payment on the day</strong>, or ensure that you are selling through an outlet where payment is guaranteed or secure.</li>
<li><strong>Keep up to date</strong> on all IFA work on <a href=""http://ifalegacystagi.wpengine.com/covid19"">ifa.ie/covid19</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Beef Taskforce. </strong>Chairman Michael Dowling wrote to IFA this week with an update on the various issues including the Grant Thornton reports into specifications and a breakdown of the beef price across the chain.</li>
<li>IFA has called for the <strong>marts</strong> to be reopened as soon as possible. IFA also pushing for support for the marts.</li>
<li><strong>BEEP-S. </strong>Just over 27,000 farmers applied for the BEEP-S scheme, following an intensive campaign by IFA. It is estimated that some c600,000 cows are involved, which will require funding of c€52m as opposed to the €35m allocated, if a linear cut to the payment rates of €90 per cow on the first 10 and €80 on the remainder are to be avoided.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Beef Farmers. Finishers Income. </strong>Finishers are still shipping serious losses. IFA will continue to push Minister Creed, the Government and the EU Commission hard to secure a direct payment for finishers to cover the COVID-19 and Brexit losses on cattle sold this year.</li>
<li>At the EU Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels Minister Creed sought <strong>exceptional aid for livestock</strong> producers under Articles 219 &amp; 221 of CMO due to serious falls in prices. However, IFA is strongly of the view Minister Creed and the EU Commission must secure new money to deal with the COVID crisis.</li>
<li>IFA continue to lobby TDs and push Minister Creed and Government for a <strong>direct payment scheme</strong> to make up for the COVID and Brexit related cattle price losses incurred this Spring, including release of the €24m in unspent BEAM funding to assist beef finishers, who have incurred losses in the order of €200 per head.</li>
<li><strong>Bord Bia Grass Based Beef and PGI status. </strong></li>
<li>Bord Bia has prepared proposals for an Irish Grass Fed Beef and PGI status application.<br>
In summary the proposals cover animals who meet the following key criteria;
<ul>
<li>The majority of feed from grass (90% grass or grass forage throughout the animal’s lifetime)</li>
<li>Spend greater part of their life grazing (minimum of 220 days per year).</li>
<li>Steers/heifers up to 36 months of age, Grade O- or better and fat score 2+ to 4+.</li>
<li>Beef cows up to 120 months with conformation of O+ or better and fat score 2+ to 5.</li>
<li>Born, reared, finished and slaughtered in the geographical area.</li>
</ul>
</br></li>
<li><strong>Budget 2021 Proposals</strong></li>
<li><strong>2019 Brexit Beef Price Losses</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In line with the methodology used to calculate BEAM 1, IFA has calculated Brexit related cattle prices losses for beef farmers who sold cattle between May 2019 (when BEAM 1 ended) and December 31 2019.</p>
<p>These calculations compared 2015 cattle prices(pre-Brexit) with 2019 prices.</p>
<p><strong>2019 – Brexit related price losses from May 12<sup>th</sup> to Dec 31<sup>st</sup> 2019 (BEAM II) = €160m.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2020 Brexit and COVID-19 Beef Price Losses</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Since January 2020 finisher have continued to encounter Brexit related cattle price losses. However, from mid-March finishers were hit with a second wave of COVID-19 market disturbance beef price losses, which compounded their overall losses. Using the same methodology IFA has calculated the Brexit related and COVID-19 related beef price losses as follow from Jan 1<sup>st</sup> 2020 to May 17<sup>th</sup> 2020 as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Brexit related price losses: €89.8m</strong></p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 related price losses: €21.2m</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overall Brexit/COVID-19 losses:€111m up to May 17<sup>th</sup> 2020.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2020 – Brexit and COVID-19 related beef price losses from Jan 1 to May 17. 2020= €111m</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Suckers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The national suckler cow herd of almost 1 million cows is the backbone of Ireland’s beef and livestock sector worth up to €3bn, providing top quality beef to make Ireland the fifth largest beef exporter in the world. The suckler beef sector also delivers essential socio-economic and environmental services and public goods, as well as providing a major carbon sink.</p>
<p>The support schemes for the suckler cow (BDGP and BEEP) have proven to be essential in terms of economic support and in improving efficiencies on environmental performance and delivery.</p>
<p><strong>IFA proposes:</strong></p>

Beef

Latest Beef price update 21/5/2020. Steer base price €3.60/kg. Heifers €3.60/3.70. Young bull’s R/O €3.60/3.70. Cows P/O/R/U €2.90/€3.00/€3.20/kg.
Cattle prices continue to strengthen driven by tighter supplies and strong retail demand. Factories chasing tight supplies, offering deals which include the full cost of transport, removal of weight restrictions and additional price top ups. The supply balance has swung in favour of the farmer.
Supplies. Supplies totalled 26,911 for week ending May 17th., down about 5,900 on the same week last year. Kill to date down 31,683 on 2019 levels. Y Bulls are back 30k, steers are up +10k, heifers are down -6k and cows are back -15k. However, when calves are removed, the overall adult kill is back closer to 46,000 head.
Numbers over the coming weeks expected to remain tight until the first of the grass cattle set to arrive.
Official Prices. DAFM reported Irish R3 steer prices for w/e May 10th was €3.67/kg incl vat. Heifers R3 €3.70/kg. Y Bulls O/R/U €3.33/€3.52/€3.61/kg. Cows P/O/R €2.72/€2.80/€2.99/kg.
UK cattle prices for w/e May 17th. AHBD report a 6p/kg rise in prices. R3 steers at £3.36/kg, equivalent to €3.96/kg incl vat. Heifers were up 6.4p/kg, Young bulls were up 5.4p/kg and cows were up 8.7p/kg, with -O4L at £2.43/kg equivalent to €2.86/kg.
Official cattle prices reported to the EU Commission on May 1`7th 2020. R3 Young Bulls c/kg excl vat; EU Average €3.42/kg, Germany €3.37/kg, France €3.63/kg, Spain €3.46/kg, Austria €3.45/kg Italy €3.84/kg Poland €2.68/kg. Steer Prices; Ireland €3.55/kg, UK €3.80/kg.
EU Young bull prices are up 1.86/kg on the week and EU steers are up 4.78/kg on the previous week, with cows up 1.00c/kg and heifers up 4.49c/kg.
The resumption of some manufacturing plants and some reopening of food service at EU level has helped the trade. The reopening of McDonalds and Supermacs drive-through helped the cow trade.
APS. Irish processors applied for only 20 tonnes of APS. Total applications across the EU of 706 tonnes with 400t from Poland, 230t from Holland, 46t from Spain and 10t from Austria.
Live Exports. 4,648 cattle were exported in the week commencing 04/5/2020, 3,822 to EU (Except NI). Live exports for 2020 amount to 144,977 compared to 186,276 in 2019.
Calf exports of 112,383 year to date.
There were considerable difficulties with the Algerian live export trade over recent weeks, involving loading delays, payment difficulties and delays on the first shipment. IFA assisted up to about 15 farmers getting paid in full.
When the boat, the MV Sarah returned for the second shipment, difficulties occurred between the exporter and the DAFM on horned cattle, individual weighing and withdrawal periods on medications.
Working with the exporter and the DAFM, IFA asked Minister Creed to intervene directly, which he did and all of these issues were subsequently resolved but shipments were delayed and along with TB difficulties on some farms the exporter was unable to proceed and cancelled the shipment. The livestock carrier has left Ireland empty.
IFA Payment Policy. Insist on payment on the day, or ensure that you are selling through an outlet where payment is guaranteed or secure.
Keep up to date on all IFA work on ifa.ie/covid19.
Beef Taskforce. Chairman Michael Dowling wrote to IFA this week with an update on the various issues including the Grant Thornton reports into specifications and a breakdown of the beef price across the chain.
IFA has called for the marts to be reopened as soon as possible. IFA also pushing for support for the marts.
BEEP-S. Just over 27,000 farmers applied for the BEEP-S scheme, following an intensive campaign by IFA. It is estimated that some c600,000 cows are involved, which will require funding of c€52m as opposed to the €35m allocated, if a linear cut to the payment rates of €90 per cow on the first 10 and €80 on the remainder are to be avoided.
Support for Beef Farmers. Finishers Income. Finishers are still shipping serious losses. IFA will continue to push Minister Creed, the Government and the EU Commission hard to secure a direct payment for finishers to cover the COVID-19 and Brexit losses on cattle sold this year.
At the EU Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels Minister Creed sought exceptional aid for livestock producers under Articles 219 & 221 of CMO due to serious falls in prices. However, IFA is strongly of the view Minister Creed and the EU Commission must secure new money to deal with the COVID crisis.
IFA continue to lobby TDs and push Minister Creed and Government for a direct payment scheme to make up for the COVID and Brexit related cattle price losses incurred this Spring, including release of the €24m in unspent BEAM funding to assist beef finishers, who have incurred losses in the order of €200 per head.
Bord Bia Grass Based Beef and PGI status. 
Bord Bia has prepared proposals for an Irish Grass Fed Beef and PGI status application.
In summary the proposals cover animals who meet the following key criteria;

The majority of feed from grass (90% grass or grass forage throughout the animal’s lifetime)
Spend greater part of their life grazing (minimum of 220 days per year).
Steers/heifers up to 36 months of age, Grade O- or better and fat score 2+ to 4+.
Beef cows up to 120 months with conformation of O+ or better and fat score 2+ to 5.
Born, reared, finished and slaughtered in the geographical area.


Budget 2021 Proposals
2019 Brexit Beef Price Losses

In line with the methodology used to calculate BEAM 1, IFA has calculated Brexit related cattle prices losses for beef farmers who sold cattle between May 2019 (when BEAM 1 ended) and December 31 2019.
These calculations compared 2015 cattle prices(pre-Brexit) with 2019 prices.
2019 – Brexit related price losses from May 12th to Dec 31st 2019 (BEAM II) = €160m.

2020 Brexit and COVID-19 Beef Price Losses

Since January 2020 finisher have continued to encounter Brexit related cattle price losses. However, from mid-March finishers were hit with a second wave of COVID-19 market disturbance beef price losses, which compounded their overall losses. Using the same methodology IFA has calculated the Brexit related and COVID-19 related beef price losses as follow from Jan 1st 2020 to May 17th 2020 as follows.
Brexit related price losses: €89.8m
COVID-19 related price losses: €21.2m
Overall Brexit/COVID-19 losses:€111m up to May 17th 2020.
2020 – Brexit and COVID-19 related beef price losses from Jan 1 to May 17. 2020= €111m.

Support for Suckers

The national suckler cow herd of almost 1 million cows is the backbone of Ireland’s beef and livestock sector worth up to €3bn, providing top quality beef to make Ireland the fifth largest beef exporter in the world. The suckler beef sector also delivers essential socio-economic and environmental services and public goods, as well as providing a major carbon sink.
The support schemes for the suckler cow (BDGP and BEEP) have proven to be essential in terms of economic support and in improving efficiencies on environmental performance and delivery.
IFA proposes:

Suckler farmers need a targeted payment of €300 per cow, facilitated by a combination of CAP and national funding.
For 2020, a total of 27,000 suckler farmers have applied for the BEEP-S scheme, with up to 600,000 cows. At the payment rates of €90 on the first 10 cows and €80 on the remainder, the funding costs of this scheme will be €52m in 2020, as opposed to the €35m allocated in Oct 2019. Therefore, this scheme will need a budget injection of an additional €17m for 2020
The last annual payment under the current BDGP scheme is due in Nov/Dec 2020 and the BEEP-S scheme is an annual scheme.
For 2021, the IFA is proposing the BDGP is renewed and simplified with funding increased from €45m to €90m pa and the BEEP-S scheme is funded to the tune of €52m pa.
This would provide total funding of €142m pa for sucklers and enable payment rates of €290 per cow on the first 10 cows and €250 per cow on the remainder.

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said there are some small positive signs on the cattle price side, with some factories paying a base of €3.45/kg for steers and €3.50/kg for heifers this week as the numbers of in-spec finished cattle continue to tighten.</p>
<p><span id=""more-21445""></span></p>
<p>Some factories have broken the €3.40/kg base price barrier to get stock. As was expected based on the AIMs data, the number of in-spec finished cattle has tightened and will continue to get tighter over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said cow prices are also rising with good R grade cows up 15/20c/kg over the last week to 10 days, reflecting increased market demand for manufacturing beef based on higher retail sales and as some burger and manufacturing plants plan to re-open.</p>
<p>With major increases in retail sales, Brendan Golden called on supermarkets to pass back some of the higher revenues from consumers back down the chain to hard-pressed farmer finishers.</p>
<p>“Agriculture Minister Michael Creed can no longer ignore the financial calamity that has played out on beef finishing farms before and since the COVID-19 crisis,” he said.</p>
<p>Prior to COVID-19, beef prices were extremely poor due mainly to Brexit uncertainty and exchange rate problems and farmers selling cattle were facing losses in the order of €100 per head. Since then, beef prices have fallen from a base of €3.65/kg to €3.40/kg and inflicted another €100 per head in price losses.</p>
<p>The IFA livestock leader said Minister Creed must add to the unspent BEAM funding and immediately put in place a direct payment scheme to help make up for the price losses on finishing farms this spring.</p>
<p>Regarding the APS scheme announced by the EU Commission, Brendan Golden said IFA has lobbied hard in Brussels to get market support and has also lobbied this week to have the scheme extended to cover O grade animals and boneless cuts. He said the factories have to respond and this must be reflected in some benefits in terms of improved prices back to farmers.</p>
<p>He said the EU Commission will have to introduce an emergency EU financial aid package for those Member States where COVID-19 problems have resulted in significant market and price losses.</p>
<p>The Commission has all the data on the price and income losses pre and post COVID-19 and is in a position to target direct income support to the farmers in the Member States that have been affected the most.</p>
<p>He said “Family farmers selling 50 cattle are facing losses of €10,000. They simply cannot afford this level of loss, especially having come through two very difficult years in 2018 and 2019”.</p>

<p>“While there are very real concerns regarding clusters of COVID-19 in some plants, the vast majority of processing facilities have had few or no cases. Processors are going to great lengths to ensure the safety of their workers,” he said.</p>

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said cattle prices are rising on the back of tighter supplies and stronger market demand across the EU.</p>
<p><span id=""more-21454""></span></p>
<p>He said the re-opening of burger and manufacturing outlets and an increase in live exports are all combining to lift the trade.</p>
<p>“Factories have increased the base price for some steers and heifers by between 10c/kg to 15c/kg in places over the last week, with some finishers commanding a base price of €3.55/3.60/kg,” he said.</p>
<p>In general, the base price has moved from €3.40/kg for steers and heifers to €3.45/3.50/kg with some deals at €3.55/3.60/kg. He said in-spec finished cattle are gone very tight and factories are having to pay more to get stock.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said cow prices are also up 20c to 30c/kg in places. “Last week some factories were offering as low as €2.50/kg for P and O grade cows. This stock has achieved €2.70 and €2.80/kg in some plants this week with immediate purchase and slaughter, reflecting the strong demand from burger and manufacturing plants.”</p>
<p>The live trade has also driven on young bull prices, together with much tighter supplies. R and U grade bulls are making €3.50/3.60/kg.</p>

In general, the base price has moved from €3.40/kg for steers and heifers to €3.45/3.50/kg with some deals at €3.55/3.60/kg. He said in-spec finished cattle are gone very tight and factories are having to pay more to get stock.
Brendan Golden said cow prices are also up 20c to 30c/kg in places. “Last week some factories were offering as low as €2.50/kg for P and O grade cows. This stock has achieved €2.70 and €2.80/kg in some plants this week with immediate purchase and slaughter, reflecting the strong demand from burger and manufacturing plants.”
The live trade has also driven on young bull prices, together with much tighter supplies. R and U grade bulls are making €3.50/3.60/kg.

<p><span id=""more-21421""></span><br>
Brendan Golden said Minister Creed and Commissioner Wojciechowski cannot continue to ignore the beef crisis in Ireland. IFA has put forward specific proposals for APS (Aids to Private Storage) market support and direct payment support for beef farmers.</br></p>
<p>At national level, IFA has called on Minister Creed to immediately mobilise and make available to beef farmers the unspent €24m from BEAM funds in the form of a direct payment to farmers selling cattle, pending a more comprehensive EU package. “The Minister can do this immediately. The EU Commission has specifically instructed Member States to re-allocate unused funds.”</p>
<p>IFA is also demanding that the EU should suspend non-EU beef imports, which amounted to 318,500t in 2019. “Up to 80% of these imports are coming from Mercosur countries like Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay and are made up of steak cuts destined for the EU food service market.

<p>“Beef farmers are incurring major income losses with prices down 25c to 30c/kg in the last three to four weeks, well over €100/animal. Prices are back 40c/kg or €150 per head on 2015 (pre-Brexit) levels”.</p>
<p>The Irish beef sector is export oriented, with a very small domestic market. 30% of the value of carcases is made up of steak cuts and 60% of Irish steaks are sold to the food service sector.

<ul>
<li>Extremely difficult beef market situation across the EU, with cattle prices continuing to ease back. With restaurants other food service and manufacturing outlets closed demand remains very subdued. Real difficulties for steaks and cow beef.</li>
<li>While there is an increase in retail demand for mostly mince and diced beef this has not made up for the closure in the food service sector. The position is compounded in Ireland due to our strong export dependence.</li>
<li>Some positives in the market with Supermacs reopening some drive-ins and also better reports from some EU markets.</li>
<li>6,983 cattle were exported in the week commencing 06/4/2020, 6,386 to EU (Except NI). Live exports for 2020 amount to 118,963 compared to 136,544 in 2019. 92,830 calves exported to date this year.</li>

<p><strong>General Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Following intensive lobbying by IFA at National and EU level, the EU Agriculture Commissioner announced a €80m package of market measures, mainly Aids to Private Storage (APS) for beef, sheep and dairy in Brussels this week.</li>
<li>On beef, the APS is for €25m covering 25,000t of forequarter beef.</li>
<li>The draft Commission regulation specifies APS for separated hindquarters bone in. It also specifies grades of S, E, U and Rs with aid of €1,008/t for 90 days storage, €1,033/t for 120 days and €1,058/t for 150 days.</li>
<li>IFA has told the DAFM and EU Commission there needs to be more flexibility and that O grades must be included, boneless cuts must be covered and the rate need to be increased.</li>
<li>For sheep, the APS is for 36,000t, worth €20m.</li>
<li>On sheep, the draft regulation specifies fresh or chilled carcasses of lamb aged less than 12 months of age, with aid per tonne of €866 for 90 days, €890 for 120 days and €915 for 150 days.</li>
<li>Again, IFA has made it clear to the DAFM and the Commission there needs to be flexibility, the age needs to increase, specific cuts such as legs etc must be included and the rate per tonne needs to increase.</li>
<li>IFA is continuing to lobby hard at National and EU level for a much greater and more comprehensive package of measures to address the market and income crisis on beef result of the COVID-19 Emergency.</li>
<li>IFA demands and action are based on market supports around an effective type of APS (Aids to Private Storage) and direct payment to farmers on price losses. IFA are also demanding action to suspend non-EU beef imports.</li>
<li>At National level IFA are requesting Minister Creed to immediately make available the c€24m in unspent BEAM funds to farmers selling finished cattle at a major loss.</li>
<li>This week IFA met (conference call) with Bord Bia on progressing Irelands application for PGI status for Irish Grass Fed Beef.</li>
<li>IFA also met Bord Bia on the introduction of remote assessments for Quality Assurance Audits/inspections. This will allow farmers remain quality assured and complete audits/inspection remotely, using mobile phones and the internet and without the necessity of a farm visit.</li>
<li>IFA secured clarification regarding farmers eligibility for the weekly COVID-19 payment of €350 per week.</li>

Extremely difficult beef market situation across the EU, with cattle prices continuing to ease back. With restaurants other food service and manufacturing outlets closed demand remains very subdued. Real difficulties for steaks and cow beef.
While there is an increase in retail demand for mostly mince and diced beef this has not made up for the closure in the food service sector. The position is compounded in Ireland due to our strong export dependence.
Some positives in the market with Supermacs reopening some drive-ins and also better reports from some EU markets.
6,983 cattle were exported in the week commencing 06/4/2020, 6,386 to EU (Except NI). Live exports for 2020 amount to 118,963 compared to 136,544 in 2019. 92,830 calves exported to date this year.
Roundwood Livestock Ltd, has secured a Government contract to supply 12,000 bulls and steers to Algeria and loaded a boat out of Waterford last week.
Purcells and Viastar also buying bulls for export to Libya and Turkey.
IFA Payment Policy; Insist on payment on the day or sell through your local mart where payment is secure.
New mart arrangements are proving difficult to operate for weanlings and store cattle. Calves are easier to handle. Significant problems establishing the value of older stock in the absence of the auction ring. ICOS and marts working on an easing of restrictions with DAFM for a possible resumption of mart auctions under strictly enforced protocols.
URGENT REMINDER. €90 Suckler Payment. Make sure to make your BEEP-Suckler application for €80/€90 per suckler cow by May 15th closing date. Also make your BPS application early, before the May 15th closing date.


General Issues

Following intensive lobbying by IFA at National and EU level, the EU Agriculture Commissioner announced a €80m package of market measures, mainly Aids to Private Storage (APS) for beef, sheep and dairy in Brussels this week.
On beef, the APS is for €25m covering 25,000t of forequarter beef.
The draft Commission regulation specifies APS for separated hindquarters bone in. It also specifies grades of S, E, U and Rs with aid of €1,008/t for 90 days storage, €1,033/t for 120 days and €1,058/t for 150 days.
IFA has told the DAFM and EU Commission there needs to be more flexibility and that O grades must be included, boneless cuts must be covered and the rate need to be increased.
For sheep, the APS is for 36,000t, worth €20m.
On sheep, the draft regulation specifies fresh or chilled carcasses of lamb aged less than 12 months of age, with aid per tonne of €866 for 90 days, €890 for 120 days and €915 for 150 days.
Again, IFA has made it clear to the DAFM and the Commission there needs to be flexibility, the age needs to increase, specific cuts such as legs etc must be included and the rate per tonne needs to increase.
IFA is continuing to lobby hard at National and EU level for a much greater and more comprehensive package of measures to address the market and income crisis on beef result of the COVID-19 Emergency.
IFA demands and action are based on market supports around an effective type of APS (Aids to Private Storage) and direct payment to farmers on price losses. IFA are also demanding action to suspend non-EU beef imports.
At National level IFA are requesting Minister Creed to immediately make available the c€24m in unspent BEAM funds to farmers selling finished cattle at a major loss.
This week IFA met (conference call) with Bord Bia on progressing Irelands application for PGI status for Irish Grass Fed Beef.
IFA also met Bord Bia on the introduction of remote assessments for Quality Assurance Audits/inspections. This will allow farmers remain quality assured and complete audits/inspection remotely, using mobile phones and the internet and without the necessity of a farm visit.
IFA secured clarification regarding farmers eligibility for the weekly COVID-19 payment of €350 per week.

IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden has strongly encouraged suckler farmers to apply for the new €90 per cow suckler BEEP scheme.
“BEEP-S is a new and very positive scheme, worth €90 per cow on the first 10 cows and €80 per cow on the remainder up to a maximum of 100. It’s a follow on from last year’s BEEP scheme.”
He said a farmer with 25 suckler cows will receive €2,900 this year for joining the scheme and meeting the requirements.
“IFA has campaigned strongly to deliver more supports for sucklers and lobbied very hard in the last Budget, where an additional €35m in national funding was secured for the new scheme in 2020. It’s vital that there is a strong uptake from suckler farmers.”
Brendan Golden said farmers must apply on line for the scheme and the closing date for applications is May 15th 2020. He called on the Department of Agriculture, Teagasc and private advisors to encourage suckler farmers to apply for the scheme.
“The suckler cow is the backbone of Ireland’s quality €3bn beef sector and is crucial to the survival of rural Ireland, particularly in the west, where 80% of the cows are sucklers.”
 
“IFA is determined to build on the supports now in place to ensure we have a targeted suckler payment of €300 per cow in the future,” he said.
Suckler cow farmers, who complete all of the mandatory and optional actions under the scheme will receive payment of €90 per cow on the first 10 cows and €80 on the remainder, up to a limit of 100 cows.
The weighing aspect of the scheme is mandatory and will involve a payment of €50 per cow/calf on the first 10 and €40 on the remainder. An additional €30 will be paid for an animal welfare action, with an option of a pre-weaning meal feeding programme or vaccination.
Another €10 is available for a faecal egg testing programme.

<p>The IFA President said the ‘produced in Ireland’ logo was misleading and that retailers should not be allowed to use their own likenesses of the Bord Bia QA logo.</p>
<p>“This use of the likenesses of the Bord Bia logo, incorporating our national flag, is wrong. Retailers should only use the Bord Bia logo on meat. This logo is based on clear criteria that the beef must come from a Quality Assured Irish farm and that it is slaughtered in Ireland,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Cullinan said that, at a time when Irish farmers are being told by processors that the market for Irish beef has been severely hit due to the Covid19 crisis, retailers and processors need to support Irish farmers and others who are working in the Irish food processing sector.</p>

Mr. Cullinan said that, at a time when Irish farmers are being told by processors that the market for Irish beef has been severely hit due to the Covid19 crisis, retailers and processors need to support Irish farmers and others who are working in the Irish food processing sector.
“This comes on top of the news that the ABP Group filled orders to the UK with Polish beef. This has angered farmers at a time when they working around the clock to keep food on the table for consumers,” he said.

<p>This would allow cattle to continue to move and trade at this important time of the year for the sector. “There are no restrictions on the movement of livestock,” he said.</p>
<p>“We have been in contact with the ICOS Marts Committee. We are strongly of the view that our existing livestock mart network can provide the mechanism to facilitate the continuation of trade between farmers, while also adhering to the increased restrictions,” he said.</p>

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said the decision by McDonald’s to close its restaurants here and in the UK will put further pressure on the beef sector.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, this is what’s happening across Europe where closures have had an impact on the food service sector. However, some of this has been mitigated by an increase in retail trade as people are buying more at home,” he said.</p>
<p>The IFA President said the EU Commission and Minister Michael Creed need to instigate a series of measures to support farmers to ensure that essential food supplies continue to be available for all citizens.</p>
<p>These include:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the necessary adjustments to EU beef market supports (Intervention, APS) so as to be in a position to provide realistic beef market price supports.</li>
<li>Move to protect the internal EU market and suspend all non-EU beef imports including South American imports, which do not meet EU standards.</li>
<li>Adjustments to State Aid rules to give more flexibility to the Irish Government to support farmers.</li>
<li>Allocate the necessary funding so the Commission is in a position to provide additional urgent direct payment supports to farmers to compensate for beef market losses.</li>
<li>A review of the inspection requirements so that all farmers can get all of their direct payments without any hold up because of inspections.</li>
</ul>
<p>“The Irish beef price is already well below the cost of production for farmers.  They cannot sustain any further cuts,” he said.</p>

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said that the new €90 per suckler cow BEEP scheme announced by Agriculture Minister Michael Creed this evening is an important component in ensuring a stronger support structure for suckler cow farmers.</p>
<p><span id=""more-20505""></span></p>

IFA President Tim Cullinan said that the new €90 per suckler cow BEEP scheme announced by Agriculture Minister Michael Creed this evening is an important component in ensuring a stronger support structure for suckler cow farmers.

“The suckler cow is the backbone of Ireland’s quality €3bn beef sector and is crucial to the survival of rural Ireland, particularly in the west, where 80% of the cows are sucklers.”
“IFA is determined to build on the supports now in place to ensure we have a targeted Suckler Payment of €300 per cow in the future,” he said.

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman, Brendan Golden said the key message from the Jim Power report on the beef sector is that CAP payments to beef farmers must be increased to offset the damage done to the sector since decoupling.</p>
<p>He said the next Minister for Agriculture must insist that direct payments to beef and suckler farmers are increased in the next CAP to address the income crisis at farm level.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said the report also outlines the devastating impact of CAP cuts in the form of budget cuts, decoupling, modulation, convergence and other cuts on the incomes of livestock farmers.</p>
<p>He said Power points to Teagasc research which shows that in the top one third of Teagasc Profit Monitor farms for sucklers, the direct payments/premiums per hectare from 2008 to 2017 has fallen by €156 per hectare or 24%.</p>
<p>For non-breeding or fattening farms, the direct payments/premiums per hectare has fallen by €374 per hectare or 45%.</p>
<p>On the impact of CAP reform, Power concludes, “Direct payments are of critical importance to suckler farmers, but these payments have only increased marginally in nominal terms since 2005. This has been detrimental to suckler farmers, which in turn has been bad for beef producers in general, but for the West of Ireland in particular, where suckler farming is very important”.</p>

<p>Economist Jim Power presented his <a href=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jim-Power-Beef-Report-2020.pdf"">report on the Irish beef sector</a> to the members of the IFA National Council meeting and National Livestock Committee today.</p>
<p><span id=""more-20479""></span></p>
<p>The Irish beef producing sector is experiencing difficult market conditions at the moment. It’s being hit with a combination of negative forces. These include CAP reform, Brexit, EU and global beef market conditions, the proposed Mercosur trade deal, environmental considerations, the weak position of beef producers in the domestic supply chain, and the growth of beef animals from the dairy herd.</p>
<p>Price compression at the retail level is a key characteristic of the beef market. The price of beef is being driven down at the retail level and attempts are being made to feed the consumer a diet of cheap beef in particular and cheap food in general. The report proposes that a ban on below-cost selling should be introduced along with the appointment of a retail regulator. Unsustainable discounting should not be allowed as it is not in the interests of farmers, processors or consumers.</p>
<p>“Irish suckler beef production sector is challenged. Policy makers have to decide if it is a sector worth supporting. If stronger support is not forthcoming, many existing operators will go out of business, with very negative consequences for economic and social life in large swathes of rural Ireland, the natural landscape, and Irish agri-food exports,” the report author Jim Power said.</p>
<p>CAP funding is vital to the future of the sector and for regional development. In order to help sustain the sector, the CAP budget needs to be maintained in real terms with extra payments for extra environmental asks on farmers.</p>
<p>Among the report’s recommendations are that farmers must be properly rewarded for the environmental contribution they are making in sequestering carbon.</p>
<p>It also recommends the development of a new brand for Irish suckler beef. The Government should apply to have this underpinned by Protected Geographical Indicator (PGI) status for Irish suckler beef.</p>
<p>The lack of transparency in the sector is feeding mistrust between farmers and processors. In order to begin the process of building trust, the CCPC should launch a full investigation into competition in the sector.</p>
<p>The current focus of the debate about the in-spec requirements and whether these are being demanded by the retailers, is likely to be overtaken by environmental pressures to reduce the slaughter age. The current pricing system where farmers receive a bonus from meat processors for meeting in specification requirements is frustrating farmers.  It is important that farmers see a reward for participating in the QA Scheme. This is vital for the future of the scheme. Accordingly, the in-spec bonus system should be amended to give some meaningful bonus to all animals coming from QA herds.</p>
<p>Report author Jim Power said that “The reality is that beef production is a very challenging sector in general, but in Ireland in particular, due to the nature of the supply chain. The beef sector in Ireland is characterised by price compression at the retail level; a very concentrated processing industry; and a wide variation of beef farmer technical expertise, productivity and efficiency. Beef farmers are very dependent on direct payments, and without those payments, a large segment of beef producers would not be economically viable or sustainable”.</p>
<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said that the report demonstrates that the number one focus for all farmers in 2020 has to be the fight for a fair CAP budget.</p>
<p>“The reality is that if we want to keep economic activity in rural Ireland particularly in the West where 79% of the cows are suckler cows, North West and midlands region, we need suckler cows and a beef sector. This will not survive without strong CAP support,” he said.</p>
<p>“It is also clear that the previous strategies including <em>Foodwise 2025</em> have failed farmers with no clear plan or measurable targets to bring profitability to beef farming. The agri food 2030 strategy will have to have a clear plan for suckler farmers and the beef sector,” he said.</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said the report has a clear message for retailers. Of all the actors in the food chain, they enjoy the highest margins. The work of the Beef Taskforce is to bring greater transparency to the share out of the final retail price.</p>

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/farmers-urged-to-be-particularly-vigilant-during-spring-calving/,Farmers Urged to Be Particularly Vigilant During Spring Calving,12 February 2020,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>With spring calving now underway on many Irish farms, IFA National Farm Family Chairperson, Caroline Farrell has urged farmers to be particularly vigilant to ensure their own safety.</p>
<p>Heifers and cows can be unpredictable at calving time and may hit out without warning. Over the past 10 years livestock has accounted for 20% of farm fatalities, with the calving cow involved in over half of these fatalities.</p>
<p>The IFA Chair said, “The calving cow is the most dangerous animal on Irish farms and should not be trusted. Spring is the busiest time of year on many Irish farms. Farmers work around the clock, often needing to be up several times a night to check on animals. This can lead to severe tiredness, restricting a farmer’s ability to react quickly”.</p>
<p>The IFA has developed some useful tips for farmers to help keep them safe, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t be afraid to ask for help from a neighbour with a difficult cow or heifer</li>
<li>Know your limitations, you’re not as agile as you were this time last year</li>
<li>Make sure the calving gate is operating properly</li>
<li>Make sure the calving jack and ropes are fit for purpose</li>
<li>Cows are a prey animal and the maternal instinct of a cow is to protect her calf, especially after calving – make sure all dogs and children are out of sight before entering the pen</li>
<li>Make sure the cow is correctly locked into the calving gate</li>
<li>Ensure calving pens have appropriate lighting</li>
<li>Remember there is no such thing as a quiet cow</li>

<p><strong> </strong>IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said cattle prices are continuing to rise, but much too slowly for finishers, who need a substantial price lift at this stage.</p>
<p><span id=""more-20416""></span></p>
<p>He said supplies are much tighter and farmers need to dig in very hard, demanding more on price. “Farmers should reject the quoted prices and ask for at least 10c/kg more. Factory procurement managers are cold calling feeders trying to pin down supplies and cut deals.”</p>
<p>“It’s well known that many of the big processors don’t have as many cattle in feedlots as usual. They are trying to secure stock for the weeks ahead. With 55,000 fewer cattle in the system, based on AIMS data, supplies should get much tighter over the coming weeks.”</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said the base price for steers and heifers is continuing to creep upwards with steers making €3.60/3.65/kg and some top prices of €3.70 paid. Heifers are on €3.65 with €3.70/kg becoming more common.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said some flat price deals of €3.70/kg has been negotiated for Friesian steers.</p>
<p>Young bulls have also lifted a little with O grades making €3.40/kg, R grades €3.50/kg and up to €3.65/kg for U grades.</p>
<p>Cow price is ranging from €2.90/kg to €3.45/kg for top grade cows.</p>
<p>Brendan Golden said prices in our main export market in the UK continuing to rise with R3 grade steers up another 1p/kg for week ending Jan 25<sup>th</sup> to £3.40/kg, which is equivalent to €4.24/kg incl vat. He said the UK price is 42c/kg ahead of the Irish price.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock leader said the average R3 price paid by Irish factories for w/e Jan 25<sup>th</sup> varied from €3.99/kg in Foyle Meats in Donegal to less than €3.75/kg in a number of plants. He said there is a variation of up to 29c/kg between the top and the bottom, clearly showing that farmers should shop around and that deals are being done way above the quoted base prices.</p>

<p>“We put a very strong set of policy proposals to the party leaders on beef and livestock issues including Brexit, CAP, climate action and the need for a €300 per suckler cow payment.”</p>
<p>“Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was strong on Brexit saying there can be no tariffs, no taxes and no quotas in any EU deal with the UK.  He gave a full endorsement to the live export trade and said he would maximise the CAP budget from the EU and top it up, if necessary, with national funding. On sucklers supports, the Fine Gael leader there will be a new BEEP scheme in 2020, with double the funding to €40m,” he said.</p>
<p>The Fianna Fail leader Micheál Martin committed to new additional payments of €200 per head on the first 20 suckler cows and made it clear this would be on top of the existing BDGP payment of €95/80 per cow and BEEP payments of €40 per cow.</p>
<p>He said the Fianna Fail leader committed to negotiating a higher CAP budget in Brussels. On Brexit, the Fianna Fail leader said the UK/EU deal must involve zero tariffs and zero quotas.</p>
<p>He added that he would negotiate a BEAM II scheme and pay out the €25m underspend in BEAM I to farmers. He was fully supportive of live exports.</p>

IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden said the IFA have received clear commitments from the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the leader of Fianna Fail Micheál Martin that there will be no cuts to the suckler cow herd and they will increase direct payments to sucklers in the next Government.

<p>IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan has called for the urgent publication of the detailed provisions of the Calf Investment Scheme, which is to open for applications today, 7<sup>th</sup> January. It was announced before Christmas by the Minister for Agriculture, Michael Creed.</p>
<p>Tom Phelan added that additional funds must be provided in the case of oversubscription.</p>
<p>“The scheme is an important element in supporting farmers who will need to manage increased numbers of dairy calves next spring.  While the €1.5m funding is welcome, this is equivalent to only €1 per calf born within the dairy herd.  Should the scheme be oversubscribed, it would be vital that additional funding would be made available,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“An informative FAQ has been published, but there are no detailed specs available for the type of equipment which will be deemed eligible, nor is there any indication of how quickly farmers will know whether their application has been approved.  Given the need for farmers to take prompt action before the impending calving period, it is crucial that the fullest details be published by the Department urgently,” he concluded.</p>

<p>As part of the campaign for higher beef prices, the IFA today blockaded the ‘goods in’ depot at Dunnes Stores in Cornelscourt in Dublin.</p>
<p>The protest follows action at the other main retailers late last week and week seeking an increase in Irish beef prices which are now well behind the Bord Bia export benchmark price and the UK price.</p>
<p>“Dunnes Stores has no problem in discounting their beef by 40%. Worse, Dunnes thinks it’s not a problem for farmers. If anybody believes the retailer takes the full hit in these discounting campaigns, they are living in cloud cuckoo land. This week, IFA made a submission for stronger retail legislation, including the establishment of an independent regulator who will take on the retail bosses. It cannot happen soon enough, assuming the Government is prepared to stand up and take on the powerful interests which dominate the food chain,” he said.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said that Irish farmers are overdue a significant beef price increase. The latest Bord Bia Beef Price Index shows that the gap between Irish prices and our main export markets has widened again. It now stands at 21c/kg, up from 20c/kg the previous week. This gap has increased from 5c/kg in mid-October to 21c/kg last week, highlighting the improvement in beef market prices to the factories.</p>
<p>“The facts are the factories have pocketed these market improvements over the last five to six weeks and the Bord Bia Price Index proves this,” he said.</p>

This still leaves the Irish price well short of the Bord Bia EU Benchmark and it remains over 50c off the UK price as their market continues to strengthen. The UK price increased again last week and sterling improved to 84p/€ last Friday,” he said.
“It is clear, based on market increases, that the factories including ABP could have increased cattle prices some weeks ago, but they did not. Instead, they pocketed the increases for themselves and refused to pass it back to farmers. MII representing the factories adopted the same stalling tactic at the Beef Taskforce.”
“Farmers are also appalled to see Tesco advertising ‘half price’ beef in the last few days. This unsustainable discounting puts downward pressure on beef prices and is an insult to farmers and the work they do,” he said.
“IFA will continue with our action until we have a substantial price increase. We don’t have to wait until ‘price setting Friday’, as ABP insisted in their press statement. This can happen any day. This sort of controlling practice only serves to fuel the belief amongst farmers that ABP are abusing their dominant position in the market. I would call on the other meat processors to break from this practice and announce a further price increase immediately, in line with increases in the market.” he said.

<p>“Beef prices in our main export market in the UK have turned the corner and are rising. In addition, sterling has strengthened considerably in recent weeks.

Relations between factories and farmers have actually worsened since September 15<sup>th</sup> and the Minister has sided with the factories by accepting their petty explanation for keeping legal threats in place” he said.</p>
<p>“The agreement brokered in September commits all parties to bringing disputes to the Beef Taskforce before they are escalated.

<p>IFA President Joe Healy has welcomed the extension to the BEEP scheme for weighing animals as announced by the Minister for Agriculture, Michael Creed.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said the deadline for weighing cows and calves under the BEEP (Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot) Scheme has been extended to November 8th and farmers have up to November 15th to have the data submitted to ICBF.</p>
<p>IFA had called for an extension to the scheme earlier this week and the President was in direct contact with Minister Creed on the matter.</p>
<p>The IFA President encouraged farmer applicants under the scheme to immediately weight cows and calves in order to qualify for the €40 payment.</p>

<p>Joe Healy said a strong IFA campaign had secured the €20m funding in the BEEP scheme in 2018 and this was followed up with another €20m in 2019. In addition, a further €20m was delivered for the beef sector in Budget 2020 for animal welfare and vaccination.</p>
<p>He said it was very important that there was a positive response from farmers to these schemes, which provide valuable support for suckler farmers.</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy has called on the Minister for Agriculture, Michael Creed to extend the closing date of November 1<sup>st</sup> to provide additional time for suckler farmers to weigh and submit their details under the BEEP scheme.

<p>Joe Healy said the volume of records being submitted to ICBF under the scheme has increased in recent weeks, with up to 35,000 records being submitted weekly.</p>
<p>The IFA President said a major push is needed from all concerned –  the Minister, DAFM, ICBF and farmers in order to maximise the number of respondents weight recording.</p>
<p>“The closing date needs to be extended and a strong promotional drive initiated at farm level through email, text and telephone so as maximise the response.”</p>
<p>He said, “It makes real sense to extend the closing date for the submission of weights under BEEP. Farmers will be able to the maximise funding under the scheme. Every set of weights recorded will add to the valuable data base in ICBF which will help drive further genetic gain and environmental progress.”</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy said the refusal of Larry Goodman and the ABP group to lift all the injunctions against farmers arising from the recent beef dispute was petty and mean spirited. It amounts to Larry Goodman giving ‘two fingers’ to the Minister.</p>

<p>The Minister should have ensured that the injunctions and legal proceedings were lifted before today. This was a clear commitment in the beef sector agreement presided over by Minister Creed last month,” he said.</p>

<p>C &amp; D Foods is wholly owned by Larry Goodman and the ABP Group. IFA is acting for one of the farmers and has been in contact with ABP’s legal representatives seeking the removal of these injunctions.</p>

“Today’s events were avoidable.  IFA had made it clear to the Minister that the legal proceedings had to be resolved prior to the Task Force convening and we did not go into to today’s meeting,” he said.
C & D Foods is wholly owned by Larry Goodman and the ABP Group. IFA is acting for one of the farmers and has been in contact with ABP’s legal representatives seeking the removal of these injunctions.
“What we saw today was a further boiling over of frustration from farmers who see Larry Goodman doing what he likes in contradiction to a written agreement negotiated by the Minister,” he said.

<p>Joe Healy said, “I have asked Minister Creed to address the immediate and growing difficulty facing farm families, who for the past number of weeks, and in some instances, months have been unable to spread slurry due to poor weather and ground conditions”.</p>
<p>“The need to resolve this issue is significant, with an increasing number of farmers expressing concern as the end date is fast approaching.

<p>“Met Éireann is anticipating that ‘over the coming week, rainfall totals are currently looking to be above normal again, possibly up to twice the average’.

<p><span id=""more-20111""></span></p>
<p>Angus Woods strongly encouraged all eligible farmers to apply for the scheme. “Any farmer attending the Ploughing Championships this week, who has not already applied, should visit the Department stand, assess the amount of money they can draw down, and make an application,” he said.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said IFA has pushed Minister Creed hard to allow flexibility on the restrictive conditionality applied to the scheme and he has committed to this. “He has agreed to look at increasing the payment rates for suckler cows under the scheme, and other conditionality.”</p>
<p>Department staff will be available to assist farmers in making their applications at the National Ploughing Championships which start tomorrow in Fenagh, Co Carlow.</p>
<p>“IFA has made it very clear to Minister Creed every single €uro of the €100m BEAM scheme must be drawn down and paid out to farmers. Considering the income crisis in beef, it would be a crime to allow any of this hard-won funding go back to Brussels or the exchequer.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IFA has also asked Minister Creed to remove the restrictive conditions preventing farmers from applying. “The Minister needs to reassess the restrictions, including the 5% reduction in organic Nitrogen; the 100 head and 40 head suckler limits; restriction on dairy farmers with a beef enterprise; partnerships and farmers who exported finished cattle to Northern Ireland”.</p>

Department staff will be available to assist farmers in making their applications at the National Ploughing Championships which start tomorrow in Fenagh, Co Carlow.
“IFA has made it very clear to Minister Creed every single €uro of the €100m BEAM scheme must be drawn down and paid out to farmers. Considering the income crisis in beef, it would be a crime to allow any of this hard-won funding go back to Brussels or the exchequer.”
 
IFA has also asked Minister Creed to remove the restrictive conditions preventing farmers from applying. “The Minister needs to reassess the restrictions, including the 5% reduction in organic Nitrogen; the 100 head and 40 head suckler limits; restriction on dairy farmers with a beef enterprise; partnerships and farmers who exported finished cattle to Northern Ireland”.
 
IFA has also been in direct contact with Commissioner Hogan on these issues.

<p>IFA President Joe Healy has clarified the IFA position on the 30-month age rule and other criteria applied by factories for farmers to receive a 12c/kg ‘In-spec’ bonus payment.</p>
<p><span id=""more-20106""></span></p>
<p>Joe Healy said “The IFA position has always been that all prime cattle from Quality Assured herds should receive a QA bonus, with no other additional specification or criteria, such as the 30 months age limit.” IFA put this position very strongly to Minister Creed and the factories at the beef talks.</p>
<p>Along with membership of the QA Scheme, the 30-month requirement is one of four other criteria applied by factories to qualify for the 12c per kg ‘In Spec’ bonus payment.</p>
<p>These additional criteria are:</p>
<ul>
<li>animals under 30 months of age;</li>
<li>maximum four farm residencies;</li>
<li>70-day residency prior to slaughter;</li>
<li>grades of O= or better, and between 2+ and 4= fat score.</li>
</ul>
<p>To justify these specs, the meat factories have stated that these are demanded by some other countries and by some retailers, particularly in the UK. This position has been supported by Bord Bia and the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>The 30-month rule has its origins in the BSE crisis. Time has moved on and there is no longer any veterinary basis for the rule. However, some countries and some UK retailers continue to have it as a requirement. If we want to supply their markets, we have to meet their specifications.</p>
<p>As part of the original agreement in Backweston on August 21<sup>st</sup>, it was agreed that ‘An in-depth review of market and customer criteria in relation to the four In-Spec bonus criteria will be carried out’.</p>
<p>This position was accepted by all the farmer representatives present on the night on the basis that we needed to understand the full consequences for Irish cattle prices and market access of removing or adjusting any or all of the four specifications.</p>
<p>The IFA National Council and National Livestock Committee met this week and supported the in-depth review agreed with Minister Creed.  They made it clear that if the review shows that these specifications are not justified, then they should be removed.</p>
<p>The IFA President said throughout this beef crisis, farmers have been fed a huge amount of false and misleading information. This has raised completely unrealistic expectations. There has been a lot of talk about ‘leadership’ during this crisis. Leadership is about more than just telling people what they want to hear.</p>

<p><strong><br>

<p>Mr. Healy said that the terms of reference would have to be agreed with farmers, but the Commission should have full access to the books of the meat processors and be able to establish what they are paid for each part of the beef animal. “Full transparency on the price along the chain must be an essential element of the investigation,” he said.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said if this was done alongside a price commitment from the factories and an assurance from Minister Creed to put a Brexit support scheme in place for all farmers who sold cattle after May 12<sup>th</sup>, it could provide a basis for a resolution to the current stalemate.</p>
<p>The Commission must also be able to verify if certain specifications are being demanded by retailer customers and if this justifies these being applied in respect of cattle prices.  It should also look at what is going on with factory-controlled feed lots and how these are being used to manipulate cattle prices</p>
<p>The Commission must have the power to compel witnesses to appear and should also get access to financial information from processors and retailers to establish the profit margin they are making from beef.</p>
<p>“A number of months ago, IFA engaged economist Jim Power to investigate some of these matters.

IFA President Joe Healy has strongly encouraged all eligible beef and suckler farmers to apply for the €100m BEAM (Beef Exceptional Aid Measure) before the closing date of Sun, September 8th.

Joe Healy said online applications are open now and farmers should make sure to have their application completed and submitted before the closing date. He said any farmer that does not have access to a computer should seek assistance from the Department of Agriculture, Teagasc, their private planner or IFA.
 
He said the €100m scheme, which was secured by IFA, is worth €100 per finished animal and €40 per suckler cow.

<p>IFA Inputs Project Team Leader John Coughlan said compound feed prices are out of line with ingredient costs.  He called on the industry to reduce ration prices immediately given the perilous state of the beef finishing sector.</p>
<p>John Coughlan said, “Many compound feed mills are not reflecting the significant reduction in cereal prices, which unfortunately for tillage farmers are back by as much as €50/t. The failure by the mills to pass through the significant reduction in cereal costs Is indicative of a major swing by compound feed manufacturers, over recent years, away from the use of native cereals to imported maize and by products. Such a move is potentially undermining the provenance of Irish food production at a time when there is an increased focus on the carbon footprint.”</p>
<p>“The feed sector has a duty to maximise native cereals. It has been shown time after time that livestock rations that include a high level of quality native Irish cereals consistently outperform many compound feed rations based on least cost formulations, which invariably use high levels of imported by-products. Irish cereal production not only has an extremely low carbon footprint, but also enhances biodiversity when compared to imported feed ingredients.”</p>

Based on data presented by the Department of Agriculture, over 37,000 beef finishers and 55,000 suckler farmers are eligible.

<p>Thomas Cooney, Smart Farming Programme Leader said, “Farmers are the custodians of the rural environment and their increasing participation in the voluntary Smart Farming programme demonstrates their willingness and desire to focus on both improving their farm returns while enhancing the rural environment.

<p>Mary Frances Rochford, EPA Programme Manager in the EPA’s Office of Environmental Sustainability added, “Clean water is essential to our health and wellbeing and conserving water is essential in the context of our changing climate. We must do more to halt deterioration in water quality so that we protect this most precious public resource. Smart Farming plays an important role in addressing water conservation and water quality in the farming sector. Successful implementation of the measures need wide and willing take up by the farming community.”</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy has said that retailers and the EU Commission must be included in the talks that the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed has convened for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Tullamore Show today (Sun), Joe Healy said, “While the factories are the main problem, the retailer has a dominant role in the dysfunctional food chain that is not working for beef farmers. They need to be around the table tomorrow to account for their actions and to outline how they intend to address the problem”.</p>
<p><span id=""more-20037""></span></p>
<p>Joe Healy said the EU Commission needs to be represented to explain why they are allowing the EU beef market to be totally undermined with imports which fail to meet EU standards and also to outline their plans and supports for the Irish and EU beef sector in Brexit.</p>
<p>The IFA President said the letter sent by Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) to farmers involved in the Beef Plan Movement shows that the current rules and enforcement structure in the area is a complete joke.</p>
<p>“They need to be replaced with a new regulator who acts for all parties in the chain,” he said.</p>
<p>“If anyone needs to be investigated, it is the meat factories. The Competition Authority has previously raided the IFA offices and threatened us and other farmers on numerous occasions. The CCPC is not fit for purpose from a farmer’s point of view,” he said.</p>
<p>“New EU legislation on the Agri Markets Task Force needs to be implemented here. It will require a new state agency with robust oversight and resources to enforce it,” he said.</p>

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/ifa-calls-on-green-party-to-support-beef-dairy/,IFA Calls on Green Party to Support Beef & Dairy,8 August 2019,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>Thomas Cooney, IFA Environment Chairman has rejected Green Party calls for less of Ireland’s sustainable dairy and beef produce, as a solution to the climate challenge.</p>
<p>He said, “The Green Party’s continuous attack on our national herd lacks climate credibility. Farmers in Ireland have a proud climate record, with the European Union’s Joint Research Centre confirming that our dairy farmers are number one and our beef farmers are in the top five when it comes to climate friendly food production. This is important, as the UN IPCC’s report published today (Thursday) recognises that “there is a need to produce about 50% more food by 2050 in order to feed the increasing world population.” The report also highlights that this will lead to “significant increases in GHG emissions” driven by a 6-21% increase in the area of land cleared for cropland.</p>
<p>Cheap shots at Ireland’s dairy and beef farmers demonstrates ignorance of the fact, that demand for protein rich foods produced in Ireland will increase. Therefore, climate advocates have two choices: either back Ireland’s grass-based, carbon friendly model of food production, or support the on-going clear-felling of the Amazonian and other forested regions to create new croplands to meet the increase demand for food.”</p>
<p>Thomas Cooney has expressed his frustration at the Green Party’s failure to back IFA’s calls for a fairer farmers’ share of the retail price of their produce.  “The Green Party has not supported IFA’s call for a ban on below cost selling of farm produce. It has also failed to support the introduction of a retail ombudsman who would bring transparency to the profiteering and sharp practices in the food supply chain, which leave farmers getting 20% of the retail price of food they produce.</p>
<p>It’s time our politicians started to respect the premium product Irish farmers produce and introduce legislation, which ends profiteering of others in the food chain.”</p>

<p><strong>SUBSTANTIALLY MORE FUNDING AND SUPPORTS NEEDED FOR BEEF SECTOR IN CRISIS – IFA</strong></p>
<p>IFA President Joe Healy said today (29 July) that given the increasing threat of a no-deal Brexit, substantially more EU and Government funding and supports will be needed for the beef sector.</p>
<p>Joe Healy was responding to the details announced by Minister Creed this morning for the distribution of the €100m fund, first announced by Commissioner Hogan last May.</p>
<p>He said farmers urgently need more support and a clear roadmap from Brussels and Dublin as to how they will support the agricultural sector, should a no-deal Brexit come to pass.</p>
<p>The scheme announced today covers losses from 24<sup>th</sup> September 2018 to May 10th 2019. While this is important, unfortunately prices have deteriorated much further since May, with base prices down by 45c/kg or €160/Hd.</p>
<p>IFA is calling on the Government and EU Commission to immediately;</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure further direct aid support for farmers to deal with losses incurred, particularly for beef farmers, post-May 2019. These ongoing losses are due to the decline in the value of sterling and market disturbance arising from Brexit uncertainty.</li>
<li>Make available the €1bn EU fund immediately to stabilise the Irish and EU beef market, which is now in crisis.</li>
<li>Ban the importation of 270,000t of Mercosur beef imports from south America, which has consistently failed to meet European standards in audits by the EU Food and Veterinary Office.</li>
<li>In the event of a no-deal/hard Brexit which reduces market access and increases barriers to trade, the EU must make available structural and adjustment funding. In this context State-aid rules must be set aside.</li>
<li>Secure increased funding for the CAP in the next MFF 2021-2027.</li>
<li>Reject the proposal to cut the Irish allocation by €97m pa and seek an increase to take account of inflation and the extra demands on farmers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there may be further issues in terms of a shortfall in 2020, EU or national funding may be required in this instance.</p>
<p>IFA President Joe Healy said beef farmers are now in dire straits with the threat of a no-deal Brexit causing mayhem in the EU Beef market, which is now in crisis.</p>
<p>On the €100m scheme itself he said that while he welcomed the fact that animals controlled by factories were excluded, he was concerned that the limits and conditions put in place by Minister Creed could lead to an under spend of the fund.</p>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said, “The Minister has said that the payment rate to farmers might be cut if the scheme is over spent. We want a commitment from the Minister that if the money is underspent, that he will re-look at some of the limits and restrictions, or increase the payment rate. It would be a travesty if some this funding went unspent due to restrictions put in place by the Minister,” he said.</p>
<p>“The Minister could have paid this funding on all prime cattle (young bulls, steers and heifers) as set out in IFA’s six principles and ensured the fund was fully spent. We would be concerned that the way the scheme is now structured will result in the fund being underspent,” said Angus Woods.</p>

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has described proposals to cut the national suckler cow herd from the Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC) as, “unacceptable, lazy and  flawed”.</p>
<p>He called on the Agriculture Minister, Michael Creed to immediately reject these discriminatory and nonsensical proposals.</p>

IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has described proposals to cut the national suckler cow herd from the Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC) as, “unacceptable, lazy and  flawed”.
He called on the Agriculture Minister, Michael Creed to immediately reject these discriminatory and nonsensical proposals.
“Minister Creed is on record as saying there is no Government agenda to cut the suckler herd. The Minister needs to make it clear that this report from the CCAC is not Government policy, and that he will not be supporting it”.
“In a report commissioned by IFA in 2018, UCC Prof. Thia Hennessey calculated that a 50 % cut in the suckler cow herd would result in a €1.5bn reduction to national economic output, with up to 80% of the impact in western counties from Donegal to Kerry,” he said.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/suckler-cow-cut-proposal-based-on-flawed-logic/,Suckler Cow Cut Proposal Based on Flawed Logic,24 July 2019,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>IFA President Joe Healy has described proposals in the recently published Climate Advisory Council (CAC) report to significantly reduce the national suckler herd, as being based on the flawed logic of looking at emissions from food production on a single country basis.</p>
<p>The IFA President said, “The proposed cut in the herd takes no account of the economic or social consequences, particularly for areas where beef production is the backbone of the local economy, with cattle farmers spending over €1.5 billion each year on agri-inputs.</p>
<p>Our farmers are amongst the most carbon efficient food producers in the world, because of our grass-based model of food production. Reducing the Irish suckler herd will result in an increase in global emissions, as beef would be produced in countries with less sustainable systems.  As I recently pointed out in our ongoing campaign of opposition to the proposed Mercosur trade deal, the Brazilians are felling the equivalent of a football pitch every minute, to meet international beef demand.</p>
<p>The CAC recommendation will continue to fuel this climate destruction. With the world population growing it is reckless to consider reducing food production in countries who have ideal climatic conditions for producing food naturally.”</p>
<p>The Government’s Climate Plan clearly identifies implementing the Teagasc Climate Roadmap as the best way to reduce emissions from agriculture.</p>
<p>Thomas Cooney, IFA Environment Chairman has strongly criticised the CAC’s lack of vision and policy direction, to drive the delivery of the 18.5 Mt of carbon savings identified in Teagasc’s Climate Roadmap, instead falling back on the lazy option of targeting food production.</p>
<p>“Farmers in Ireland continue to lead climate action. No other country in the world measures, monitors and manages carbon from farm to fork at a national level. Today over 212,000 carbon assessments have been completed across the 139,000 farms in Ireland, increased numbers of farmers are using low emissions slurry spreading equipment, GLAS is fully subscribed and all farmers who receive a basic payment farm to Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions criteria.</p>
<p>What’s it all for, if the solution now proposed by the CAC is to reduce our climate efficient food production? This is a dismal reflection on the scientific and research work of our state agencies. That these agencies are now saying that they have failed to provide the research and technical solutions to reduce emissions, so therefore production must reduce is, frankly, shocking.</p>
<p>Instead the agencies should back IFA’s call for them to collaborate with the relevant Government Departments’ and IFA to deliver the fullest potential of the emissions reductions and improvements to farm level profitability that can be delivered through the delivery of the Teagasc climate roadmap.”</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy said the EU Commission must act now on the EU Brexit beef crisis, stop substandard beef imports into Europe and also make the €1bn available immediately for direct aid and market supports.</p>
<p><span id=""more-19997""></span></p>
<p>“With cattle prices on the floor and sterling reaching new lows of 90 pence to the euro, urgent action is needed to deal with the very severe crisis in the EU beef sector,” he said.</p>
<p>“Beef prices this week are at €3.60/kg, down 10% from the same day last year when prices were already appalling.”</p>
<p>The EU Commission announced much-needed aid in May, but this only covers the period from September to May this year. More aid is needed immediately and a clear contingency plan must be put in place as we lead up to a potentially catastrophic no deal Brexit at the end of October,” he said.</p>
<p>“Commissioner Hogan has committed that the EU will make up to €1bn available in the event of the recently-announced Mercosur trade deal having a negative impact. The Commission needs to bring this funding on stream now to provide further direct aid to cover Brexit losses and to activate EU market supports immediately to put a floor under EU markets. It is clear that genuine market support measures will need to be in place sooner rather than later,” he said.</p>
<p>“We are being constantly told that the Commission ‘has the tools’ to address market disturbance. Well it’s time to use them before Irish farming is beyond repair,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Healy said the EU Commission has explained that ‘a red button’ mechanism is in place to stop substandard imports. “The Commission needs to push the red button now and stop substandard beef which is already coming in from South America. Last year, some 269,000t of beef came into the EU despite serious shortcomings in the standard of that beef,” he said.</p>
<p>The facts are that in Brazil cattle are not tagged and there is no traceability. Hormones, beta agonists and other growth promoters are widely available. These products are all illegal and banned in the EU. Brazil has endemic Foot and Mouth disease, which is a constant risk.</p>
<p>“Despite assurances by the Commission over the recent trade deal, the one thing we know is that Mercosur is currently failing to meet EU standards.  Two weeks ago, Commissioner Hogan assured European producers and consumers ‘no product will be allowed enter the EU market unless it complies 100% with EU standards’. The Commission should call stop on these imports now and insist they meet EU standards.” he said.</p>
<p>“While we appreciate the importance of trade, Europe has been over generous with these countries by turning a blind eye to double standards, including a report from their own Food and Veterinary Office which states ‘written guarantees’ given by the Brazilian authorities were ‘not reliable’” he said.</p>

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman, Angus Woods confirmed today (15<sup>th</sup> July) that IFA has been in contact with the senior management in the main beef factory groups and made it clear that beef price cuts will not be tolerated. He said IFA also informed them that they must restore prices to viable levels.</p>
<p>He said farmer confidence is on the floor and the factories have to immediately stop the price cuts, which are exploiting a very difficult market situation.</p>
<p>He said beef farmers are very angry with what they see as the factories’ refusal to support beef farmers at this difficult time. “This is not only undermining the confidence of beef and suckler farmers at a critical time for the future of the sector, it is also undermining prices and the value of our beef in the market place”.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said, “This drive to the bottom on price is inflicting severe financial hardship on farmers and sending the wrong signal to the market place, undermining the value of our product and our production standards”.</p>
<p>“This week the base price for steers is €3.60 and €3.70 for heifers. Some factories are attempting to quote lower prices, but are having to pay more than the quotes.”</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock leader said farmers with quality prime cattle are strongly resisting the price cuts and insisting that they get more than the loss-making quoted price.</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy said urgent changes are needed to the details of the €100m scheme proposed by Minister Creed yesterday.  IFA set out six principles for the distribution of the fund and the scheme should fully reflect these.</p>
<p>IFA put these principles clearly to Minister Creed at the consultation meeting yesterday.</p>
<p><span id=""more-19970""></span></p>
<p>“The Minister must take feedback on board, make the necessary changes and then move to pay out the money as soon as possible. It is imperative that the scheme is designed in such a way that every single cent of €100m committed by the EU Commission and the Irish Government is paid out to farmers,” he said.</p>
<p>“The Minister has said the scheme will cover losses up to May 10<sup>th</sup>, but prices since then have continued to fall and are now on the floor. The Minister needs to put the Commission on notice that another fund will be needed to cover on-going losses,” he said.</p>
<p>As regards the details of the scheme, he said IFA has been consistent that funds should go to the farmers who suffered the losses. This is the basis for the six principles that were endorsed at eight regional meetings (see below).</p>
<p>“The scheme should be able to exclude factory feedlots, factory-owned cattle and dealers. If these can be excluded, then the per head and overall payment limits, particularly for cattle supplied post-Christmas, should be looked at for genuine beef finishers. Farmers who finished cattle in the reference period made a big investment buying cattle.  They need to be able to clear their stocking loans and be back in the market for stores and weanlings in the autumn. The scale of losses experienced by some of these farmers is shocking,” he said.</p>
<p>“The exclusion of prime beef animals (steers, heifers and young bulls) from all mixed enterprise farms involving beef and dairy production is wrong, bearing in mind that farmers involved in other commodities or professions are eligible. These animals must be included for payment,” he said.</p>
<p>It is important that the scheme has a provision to take account of force majeure circumstances.</p>

<p>IFA will be intensifying its campaign against the Mercosur trade deal this week.</p>
<p>IFA’s National Council, National Livestock Committee and National Poultry Committee will hold a lobby session for all TDs and Senators today (Tuesday) to build opposition to the deal.</p>

IFA will be intensifying its campaign against the Mercosur trade deal this week.
IFA’s National Council, National Livestock Committee and National Poultry Committee will hold a lobby session for all TDs and Senators today (Tuesday) to build opposition to the deal.
“We will be highlighting the damage that this deal will do on a number of levels – to the rural economy here, to the global environment and to consumers,” said Joe Healy.

<p>Reacting to the outcome of the trade talks with the South American trade bloc Mercosur, IFA President Joe Healy said EU negotiators have colluded in a deal that has sold out Irish and European farmers.</p>

<p>Reacting to the publication of the Joint Oireachtas Committee report on the future of the beef sector, IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the report was a mixed bag, with some positive recommendations and some missed opportunities to address the income crisis in the sector.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said in the detailed submission made by IFA, we made it very clear to the Committee that the ‘single biggest challenge in the beef sector is the income crisis at farm level’.</p>
<p>Welcoming the stance of the Committee on their opposition to the EU-Mercosur deal, Angus Woods said with the developments in Brussels this week, Committee members must make it crystal clear at this stage they will vote down a Mercosur deal with beef in it, when it comes before the Dail.</p>
<p>He called on members of the Committee to make it clear to the Taoiseach and Minister Creed today that a Mercosur deal will not get through the Dail.</p>
<p>In relation to the lack of competition in the beef sector, Angus Woods said its disappointing that the Committee failed to call on Minister Creed to direct the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to investigate the sector.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said the absence of any recommendation on the need for increased support for the important suckler cow herd is a missed opportunity, considering that all the political parties have indicated their support for sucklers.</p>
<p>On CAP, Angus Woods said the Agriculture Committee needs to make it clear to Minister Creed and the Government that under no circumstances can a cut in the CAP Budget be tolerated. “CAP direct payments are vital for the beef and livestock sector and farmers need an increase in the CAP Budget.”</p>
<p>On Brexit, Angus Woods said the facts are beef is more exposed than any other sector and we cannot face another cliff edge in October. He said farmers are facing the third year of Brexit uncertainty and bad prices, and it is totally unfair that farmers are expected to carry all the risks</p>
<p>Angus Woods welcomed the recommendation in the report on the need for additional support for the live export trade, which he said is essential for price competition and additional market outlets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In relation to the QPS and grading, the IFA livestock leader said it is essential that farmers are properly rewarded for quality production.  He said IFA has made specific proposals for a suckler beef price premium. He added the Minister for Agriculture must guarantee that farmers are getting the correct grade for their cattle in the meat plants.</p>

In relation to the QPS and grading, the IFA livestock leader said it is essential that farmers are properly rewarded for quality production.  He said IFA has made specific proposals for a suckler beef price premium. He added the Minister for Agriculture must guarantee that farmers are getting the correct grade for their cattle in the meat plants.

<p>IFA President Joe Healy led IFA National Officers and members of the IFA Livestock Committee in a protest at the EU Commission offices in Dublin yesterday over the hypocrisy of the Commission doing a trade deal with South America.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said the protest conveyed a very strong message to the Head of the European Commission in Ireland Gerry Kiely. “The Commission has no credibility if they want to pursue a trade deal with a Mercosur group that has no regard for standards, the environment and labour laws. This flies in the face of the EU’s own climate policy.” He said this is utter hypocrisy.</p>
<p>“The Commission’s Food and Veterinary Office has repeatedly found that the Brazilian authorities, in particular, fail to meet EU standards on animal welfare, traceability, food safety and the environment,” he said.</p>
<p>“The EU Commissioner for Agriculture Phil Hogan has to stand up for Irish and European farmers and not allow EU negotiators to show such a blatant disregard for EU standards. Minister Hogan cannot allow the EU do a sell out on the beef sector to Brazil.” he said.</p>
<p>As part of IFA’s campaign, the IFA President and the Livestock Chairman Angus Woods met the chef de Cabinet DG Trade in Brussels last week, where they set out IFA’s outright opposition to any deal.

<p>“This is the ultimate test of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who must waste no time in building opposition to this at EU Council level.”</p>
<p>Angus Woods said the EU Commission Joint Research Centre conducted an assessment on the cumulative impact of trade deals which showed that increased imports from Mercosur could cost the EU beef sector €5bn to €7bn per annum. He said the impact in Ireland would be proportionately more severe because of fact that beef is much more important to Ireland than any other EU member state and we are the largest beef exporter in the EU.</p>

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has welcomed the announcement from the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed of the simplification to some of the requirements for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said the flexibility provided for farmers in relation to the stock bull requirement in the programme is helpful and in line with some of the requests put forward by IFA specifically on this issue.</p>
<p>IFA had put detailed requests to the Department of Agriculture on these requirements. It is important the Minister has committed that his Department officials will be in contact with herdowners over the coming days who they have identified are not yet meeting the requirement.</p>
<p>He said IFA had requested that farmers who purchased a bull which was not 4 or 5 star at purchase, but has subsequently been upgraded by ICBF to be 4 or 5 star; and farmers who purchased 4 or 5 star bulls, believing them to be such, but these bulls were not genotyped; be accommodated under the scheme. The Department has now confirmed they will accommodate these changes.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said farmers who have bulls on the farm, and these bulls will be upgraded to 4 or 5 star over the next year automatically on the ICBF database as a result of their genetic evaluation improvement must also be accommodated.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said flexibility by the Department regarding implementation and interpretation of the scheme at farm level is key to providing the maximum opportunity for farmers to meet the requirements.</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy has called on the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to intervene at the highest levels in Brussels to stop a bad EU-Mercosur trade deal, which would do untold damage to our €3bn beef and livestock sector.</p>
<p><span id=""more-19891""></span></p>
<p>Speaking in Brussels, he said “In view of the major Brexit implications overhanging the Irish and EU beef sector and the environmental degradation associated with Brazilian beef exports, it would be reckless to support a Mercosur deal”.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said he has written to the Taoiseach requesting him to make it clear in the strongest possible terms to EU Commission President Jean Claude Juncker that Ireland would not be prepared to ratify a deal which will severely damage our vital national interest in beef production.</p>
<p>There is extreme concern in Brussels that EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom is pushing hard to try and finalise an EU/Mercosur deal later this month before the end of the current Commission mandate, exploiting the current political vacuum following the EP elections and before the next Commission is appointed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joe Healy said for the EU Commission to ignore the Brexit implications for beef and proceed with a Mercosur deal to import more Brazilian beef is highly irresponsible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He said a no deal Brexit would take the EU beef sector from 102% to 116% self sufficiency, with disastrous consequences for beef prices and farm incomes. This would be further compounded with any increase in imports from Mercosur. “How can the Commission ignore the fact that in Brexit the UK could impose tariffs as high as €850m pa on Irish beef and possibly the closure of market access for over 290,000t of our beef exports?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joe Healy said the EU Commission Joint Research Centre conducted an assessment on the cumulative impact of trade deals which showed that increased imports from Mercosur could cost the EU beef sector €5bn to €7bn pa.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In terms of climate change, the IFA President pointed out Irish beef production systems are 4 times more carbon efficient than South America, where increased exports are driven on the back of deforestation of the Amazon rainforests.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He said EU Commission reports consistently prove that South American beef imports, especially imports from Brazil, fail to meet EU standards on traceability, food safety, animal health, environmental and labour law. “The EU FVO report of May 2017 highlighted that the Brazilian competent authority is not in a position to guarantee that the relevant export requirements are met.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In conclusion, Joe Healy said with the major Brexit uncertainty hanging over the entire Irish economy and particularly our agriculture and beef sector, there are no circumstances where Ireland could contemplate support for an EU/Mercosur trade deal with so much negative consequences.</p>

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the proposal from the Department of Agriculture to change the equations in the classification machines at meat plants, which determine the conformation and fat score of cattle, rewards factories over farmers and is totally unacceptable.</p>
<p><span id=""more-19881""></span></p>
<p>“The Department proposed changes to the machines, which will reduce conformation scores on cattle, will take money directly out of beef farmers pockets and is totally unacceptable.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods said according to the information presented by the Department, the output of the trial of the new equations will result in a significant reduction in the conformation scores of cattle slaughtered in Ireland, which will reduce the price paid to farmers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department trial conducted in Slaney Meats was originally set up to access new lighting and camera technology for the mechanical classification machines. It was never a requirement to change or interfere with the accredited equations which determine conformation and fat score. Angus Woods said the Department have said that they want to change the equations for conformation and fat score ‘because of the changing profile of the national herd’. This is wrong and totally unacceptable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The IFA Livestock leader said the new technology fails to provide all farmers for every animal slaughtered with the correct conformation and fat score. He said “The Department of Agriculture is acutely aware of this, but refuses to provide an appeals mechanism for reasonable recourse for affected farmers to have the correct price paid by the factories for their cattle”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods said IFA has written to Agriculture Minister Michael Creed seeking an urgent meeting on mechanical classification and before the Department of Agriculture proceed with any of their proposed changes, which will penalise farmers.</p>

<p>Reacting to the draft EU regulation on the €100m Brexit beef fund circulated in Brussels today, IFA President Joe Healy said Minister Creed must reject all conditionality in the draft regulation that does not relate to the actual income losses experienced by beef and suckler farmers.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>IFA President Joe Healy wants the Government to push ahead with an independent retail regulator to give effect to tougher legislation on the food chain.</p>
<p><span id=""more-19871""></span></p>
<p>He was responding to comments by the head of the CCPC Isolde Goggin, who said the Commission didn’t have the resources to do it. “The fact that the CCPC is walking away from this won’t surprise farmers, who never had faith in the Commission to pursue retailers”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joe Healy did acknowledge that the CCPC recognises that an independent adjudicator with strong powers is needed to intervene on the ground and give farmers a hearing.</p>
<p> </p>

IFA President Joe Healy wants the Government to push ahead with an independent retail regulator to give effect to tougher legislation on the food chain.

He was responding to comments by the head of the CCPC Isolde Goggin, who said the Commission didn’t have the resources to do it. “The fact that the CCPC is walking away from this won’t surprise farmers, who never had faith in the Commission to pursue retailers”.
 
Joe Healy did acknowledge that the CCPC recognises that an independent adjudicator with strong powers is needed to intervene on the ground and give farmers a hearing.
 
“We have always held up the UK model as the basis for making real headway in this area. With the CCPC off the pitch, we want the Government to get this moving. The good work done at EU level will only have impact if there is robust enforcement on behalf of primary producers,” he said.

<p>IFA will be holding regional information meetings for livestock farmers on the €100m beef fund recently secured from Brussels and the Government.</p>
<p><span id=""more-19860""></span></p>
<p>Joe Healy said, “IFA is holding eight information meetings across the country in the month of June to update farmers on the €100m Brexit Beef Fund and to hear views on its distribution”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joe Healy said a meeting of the IFA National Council today endorsed the National Livestock Committee principles that the €100m Brexit Beef Fund should be targeted at beef finishers of prime cattle (steers, heifers and young bulls) and suckler cow farmers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joe Healy said “It is essential that the €100m Brexit beef package is targeted to the farmers who need it most.  It must be paid without delay and there must be no strings attached.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This fund was secured after a lot of hard work and lobbying by IFA. It’s for farmers – not for factories, agents or dealers. We will insist it is paid quickly and directly to farmers.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joe Healy said the allocation and targeting of the €100m to the farmers who need it most is critically important. “It must take account of the farmers who incurred the beef price losses and the income situation.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the farmers who sold prime finished cattle since last September and suckler producers are the two groups were hit the hardest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IFA has already met with EU Commission officials on the details of the €100m package, which he said was essential for winter finishers given the horrendous losses they have taken.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods said under no circumstances can Minister Creed allow one cent go to factory-owned cattle or factory feedlot cattle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Farmers who sold finished cattle through the marts must be eligible, and not agents and dealers. The Department of Agriculture has all the data and information on the AIMS system,” he said.</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy said in light of the untold potential damage of Brexit to the Irish and European beef sector, there is no way the EU Commission can propose to advance a Mercosur negotiation which involves a major increase in beef imports.</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy has welcomed the intervention by EU Commissioner Phil Hogan in the escalating fertiliser debacle that has seen the recent imposition of temporary anti-dumping duties on certain non-EU UAN fertiliser imports by DG Trade.</p>
<p>Mr Healy said, “Commissioner Hogan’s request of Competition Commissioner Vestager to take swift action to ensure the proper functioning of the EU’s internal fertiliser market, in light of questionable business practices with respect to competition rules, represents a key turning point in this case”.</p>
<p>“Commissioner Hogan’s assessment of the malfunctioning of the EU’s fertiliser market mirrors many of the conclusions raised in the IFA commissioned study into the sector, carried out by the Washington based International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). Indeed, he rightly points to the need for price transparency and the operation of fair pricing mechanisms to create a properly functioning market.”</p>
<p>“The IFPRI report, published in 2016, found that EU farmers are paying among the highest prices in the world for mineral fertilisers. Anti-dumping duties and customs tariffs imposed by the EU Commission on certain non-EU fertiliser imports were costing farmers €1 billion per annum. It established that the increased concentration of EU industry since 1994 enabled fertiliser producers to significantly increase profit margins. Indeed, DG Trade, in its recent interim expiry review of ammonium nitrate anti-dumping duties concurred with the IFPRI findings regarding increased concentration of the industry.”</p>
<p>“More alarmingly the IFPRI report identified that EU fertiliser prices not in line with the predicted model outcome. It stated that <em>“Based on the observed data, prices in Western European countries actually increased by 123%, while prices in Brazil decreased by 65% . . . . .  further suggests that additional factors, <strong>such as price fixing and cartels, </strong>might be operating in highly concentrated markets such as Western Europe”.</em></p>
<p>“In light of these findings it is all the more worrying that DG Trade saw fit to extend temporary anti-dumping (AD) duties recently to certain UAN fertiliser imports. This is despite the fact that IFA, COPA and other EU farming groups highlighted that the additional duties will cost farmers an estimated €2.7bn over the term, thus disproportionately affecting farm incomes which are already at an all-time low across many sectors.”</p>
<p>Mr Healy said, “Commissioners Malmström and Vestager must pay heed to Hogan’s request as it is in the Union’s interest to ensure that we maintain the competitiveness of the EU’s farming sector and support family</p>

IFA President Joe Healy today announced details of an IFA protest at the Cabinet meeting in Cork next Wed.  Joe Healy said farmers who have been hammered by financial losses arising from Brexit have been ignored. He said the Government commitments to support farmers have amounted to nothing so far.

“Farmers need a retrospective aid package to cover losses of €101m Brexit related beef price cuts,” he said.

<p>Addressing the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture today, IFA President Joe Healy said IFA has calculated that beef farmers have already incurred Brexit losses of €101m since last Autumn.  “Farmers cannot afford to carry this loss and it must be made good by the Government &amp; EU Commission. We have already put this to Minister Creed and we are looking for the support of the Agriculture Committee,” he said.</p>
<p>Outlining the key points in the IFA Submission, Joe Healy said the FoodWise 2025 strategy has failed to address the income crisis for beef farmers and will have to be revisited.</p>
<p>“While the strategy has delivered substantial growth in the volume and value of beef output, it has not worked for farmers,” he said.  Looking at data over the last seven years, beef exports have increased by €360m or 19%, but there has been no increase in cattle prices or farm incomes.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed and the Government must address the income crisis at farm level, and implement policies which will deliver profitability to beef and livestock farmers.</p>
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said these policies have to be based on returning a beef price to farmers above the costs of production; securing a premium price for a quality product; delivering a fairer share of  the consumer  price back to the farmer; a strong CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) with targeted direct payments; and ensuring that the European and Irish beef sector are not undermined with sub-standard South American beef imports.</p>
<p>He asked the Committee &amp; the Minister for Agriculture to request the intervention of the Competition &amp; Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) to carry out a report on the lack of competition in the beef processing sector.</p>
<p>In order to bring transparency to the sector, IFA has commissioned economist Jim Power to conduct an independent investigation into the impact of CAP policy; margins along the food supply chain; the value from all parts of the animal; the possibility of devising a formula for a beef price index; and costs of production at farm level.</p>

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/twenty-20-beef-club-represents-new-thinking-for-the-sector/,Twenty/20 Beef Club Represents New Thinking for the Sector,3 April 2019,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>IFA President Joe Healy said the Glanbia/Kepak Twenty/20 Beef Club represents much-needed new thinking for the sector.  He said the model on dairy beef could deliver greater certainty on beef prices and better cashflow on farms.</p>
<p><span id=""more-10576""></span></p>
<p>The IFA President said the contract-style pricing arrangement which Glanbia pioneered on dairy has worked well for dairy farmers and this move on beef could be a first step in a similar direction.  However, he said some of the detail needs closer examination. There would be concerns among farmers about having to purchase all of their inputs for all of their enterprises from Glanbia.</p>
<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan said this scheme encourages dairy farmers to produce a quality dairy beef animal through better breeding. It gives farmers the choice of rearing calves themselves, or selling them on to fellow-farmers to be reared in a sustainable manner.  “I believe it is important that all stakeholders, including co-ops, meat factories and AI societies in the beef and dairy sectors work together to develop a model for dairy beef which is sustainable and profitable for both beef and dairy farmers”.</p>
<p>He added that Glanbia/Kepak have explained that the scheme will be ‘anchored in the market’.  Farmers must be satisfied that the price benefits under the scheme are secured from the market place and do not in any way undermine beef prices outside the scheme.</p>
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said this move from Glanbia/Kepak involving greater certainty and reducing the risks on price is a new and important step forward for the beef sector.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said the reality is that for any beef system to be viable, including dairy beef, it must return a price above the cost of production and leave a margin for the farmer.</p>
<p>He said it is very important that beef farmers understand the precise details of the scheme, particularly the pricing model which is based on average quoted factory prices and the QPS (Quality Payment System) with additional bonuses.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said it appears that the ask from farmers in the scheme will evolve over time. Glanbia and Kepak must communicate this clearly and support farmers to generate the level of trust required for this scheme to progress and develop beyond the first two years of the pilot stage.</p>
<p>The IFA said they will be discussing the details of the scheme with both the National Dairy and National Livestock Committees as well as farmers on the ground to ensure their views are taken on board.</p>

<p>IFA Environment Chairman Thomas Cooney has described the voluntary review being undertaken by the Government as an important opportunity to build on the sustainable development of the agri-food sector.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thomas Cooney said, “Teagasc’s recently published sustainability report highlights the environmentally efficient development of the sector, with better fertiliser  and grassland management leading to reduced greenhouse gas emissions per kilo of product across all enterprises. While water quality challenges remain, the improvement in farm management practices is helping to keep Ireland’s overall water quality in the top tier in Europe.</p></blockquote>
<p>This interim review of the Nitrates Derogation must ensure that farmers who farm in derogation are supported to deliver Government’s ambitions of Food Wise 2025. It must also ensure that farmers are not saddled with excessive regulations and compliance requirements.</p>
<p>Concluding Thomas Cooney said, “Farmers have and continue to invest in the environmental improvement of their farms, whether that’s increased storage, management of run-off or farmyard management. This investment has not delivered a return from the marketplace and this issue should be addressed as part of this derogation review.”</p>

This interim review of the Nitrates Derogation must ensure that farmers who farm in derogation are supported to deliver Government’s ambitions of Food Wise 2025. It must also ensure that farmers are not saddled with excessive regulations and compliance requirements.
Concluding Thomas Cooney said, “Farmers have and continue to invest in the environmental improvement of their farms, whether that’s increased storage, management of run-off or farmyard management. This investment has not delivered a return from the marketplace and this issue should be addressed as part of this derogation review.”

<p>Farmers selling cattle at a base price of €3.75/kg for steers and €3.85/kg for heifers are taking cuts of 20-25c/kg below last year’s price levels, or reductions of up to €100 per head. Farmers selling young bulls have been hit for €200 per head.</p>

Farmers should insist on payment on the day for their cattle



 
"
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/cattle-farmers-facing-financial-ruin/,Cattle Farmers Facing Financial Ruin,19 March 2019,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said farmers selling cattle at the current unviable prices are shipping major financial losses and facing financial ruin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He called on the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed to insist that the Brexit compensation package currently being negotiated with the EU to be applied retrospectively.</p>
<p><span id=""more-10512""></span></p>
<p>The IFA Livestock leader said it is very easy for Commissioner Hogan to tell farmers ‘not to panic’ and for Minister Creed to adopt a ‘wait and see’ approach, but the financial reality is Irish beef farmers are on their knees and urgently need a tangible response from Brussels, which addresses the Brexit losses. He said IFA has put detailed proposals to the Department of Agriculture on what’s needed for the beef and livestock sector.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods said the current base price for steers at €3.75/kg and €3.85/kg for heifers are down 25c/kg on this time last year or €100 per head. He said “There was little or no margin in it last year and at the low prices this year, finishers are facing financial ruin”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods accused the factories and agents of overcooking the negativity around the cattle price, which he said has seriously damaged farmer confidence in the sector. “Cattle farmers have faced a barrage of negativity on the price since last autumn. It is incredible that the price has been stuck at a base of €3.75 for steers and €3.85 for heifers since last September.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The IFA Livestock leader pointed out that cattle prices in our main export market in the UK are £3.46 for the week ending March 9<sup>th</sup>, equivalent to €4.24/kg incl. vat at an exchange rate of 86p/€. He said this compares to the official Irish steer price of €3.84/kg for the same week, and highlights a price differential of 40c/kg or up to €150 per animal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Across the main EU markets R3 male cattle are making the following; Italy (Y Bulls) €4.31/kg, France (steers) €3.92/kg, Y Bulls €4.06/kg, Germany (Y Bulls) €3.93/kg, Spain (Y Bulls) 3.98/kg.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods said the very strong cattle price in our main export market in the UK and the stronger prices across the main EU markets for male cattle all indicate that the factories here could be paying more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On numbers, Angus Woods said the latest weekly kill of 34,200 excluding calves point to some level of tightening in supplies. This is the first time that the kill has come back to last year’s levels.</p>

Across the main EU markets R3 male cattle are making the following; Italy (Y Bulls) €4.31/kg, France (steers) €3.92/kg, Y Bulls €4.06/kg, Germany (Y Bulls) €3.93/kg, Spain (Y Bulls) 3.98/kg.
 
Angus Woods said the very strong cattle price in our main export market in the UK and the stronger prices across the main EU markets for male cattle all indicate that the factories here could be paying more.
 
On numbers, Angus Woods said the latest weekly kill of 34,200 excluding calves point to some level of tightening in supplies. This is the first time that the kill has come back to last year’s levels.

Farmers should insist on payment on the day for their cattle



 
"
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/producer-organisations-need-stronger-support-to-succeed/,Producer Organisations Need Stronger Support to Succeed,5 March 2019,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>Addressing a seminar organised by IFA on Producer Organisations today, IFA President Joe Healy said producer groups have shown their ability to organise farmers very well and negotiate additional top-up bonus prices with processors. However, the meat plants have found a way of undermining this by using very low quoted prices every week.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said, “We are also aware of numerous situations where processors and agents have used every trick in the book to pick off members of producer groups to see if they can divide and break up groups”.</p>
<p>In the livestock and beef sector, both the present Minister Michael Creed and his predecessor Minister Coveney have spoken a lot about the opportunity for beef farmers to set up producer organisations.

Addressing a seminar organised by IFA on Producer Organisations today, IFA President Joe Healy said producer groups have shown their ability to organise farmers very well and negotiate additional top-up bonus prices with processors. However, the meat plants have found a way of undermining this by using very low quoted prices every week.
Joe Healy said, “We are also aware of numerous situations where processors and agents have used every trick in the book to pick off members of producer groups to see if they can divide and break up groups”.
In the livestock and beef sector, both the present Minister Michael Creed and his predecessor Minister Coveney have spoken a lot about the opportunity for beef farmers to set up producer organisations. In theory, this is positive. But the reality is the dominant retailers and meat processors hold all the cards.
Producer Organisations need a lot more support and particularly financial support from the Department of Agriculture. €1,500 to set up a group and €1,500 for legal advice is not sufficient.

<p>IFA President Joe Healy met Minister Michael Creed yesterday on the urgent need for immediate intervention to overcome the logjam on live exports.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said that there was now a crisis for lairage space in Cherbourg which was starting to cause a logjam in calf exports. However, this is solvable if a common-sense approach is adopted by everybody.</p>
<p>The Minister had banked on a commitment from a ferry company that a second boat would be sailing on alternate days, but that has not happened. Now both companies are planning to sail on the same days. This will result in the lairage space being idle some days and over-subscribed on other days.</p>
<p>“The Minister and the Government must take a hands-on approach to this and find a solution immediately”, he said.</p>
<p>“The Minister must roll up his sleeves and make something happen to solve the problem. We have customers for our calves, but we cannot get them out of the country.  We have calves, customers and lairage space. We also have shipping capacity, but it needs to be arranged properly to ensure maximum potential is achieved. This is imperative given the extra numbers, pressure on the beef sector and the uncertainty of Brexit.”</p>
<p>We stressed to the Minister that a solution must be found to solve the problem by pursuing four options:</p>
<p>•	Personal intervention with the ferry company to reconsider their sailing dates<br>
•	Explore the possibility of getting an approved livestock ship for special sailings<br>
•	Bring back into play a lairage facility that has been used in previous years<br>
•	Additional temporary lairage facilities at Cherbourg.</br></br></br></p>

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said Agriculture Minister Michael Creed needs to take urgent action in Brussels to drive home the magnitude of the Brexit situation for the Irish beef sector and insist that immediate measures are put in place to offset the losses already encountered by farmers. He said farmers with young bulls are being fleeced with prices down by 40c to 50c/kg or €200 per head.</p>
<p>“The message from the EU Commission in Brussels is that they are waiting for political instruction.”  Angus Woods attended a meeting of the EU Commission Beef Market Observatory in Brussels last Friday, where the Commission said they have the tools and the mechanisms to support farmers, but need the political instruction.</p>
<p>“At the meeting, IFA raised the financial crisis facing cattle finishers in Ireland as a result of the Brexit uncertainty. We highlighted our dependence on the UK market and the damage already done by Brexit.”</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock leader said cattle finishers are being left in the dark, with the Minister promising but not delivering in terms of direct aid from Brussels. He said IFA has put specific proposals to the Department of Agriculture to assist the beef sector.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said the EU Commission should immediately look at restricting beef imports to improve the situation. The EU (including the UK) imports circa 330,000t of beef annually, of which about 245,000t or 75% comes from the Mercosur countries. The production standards in these countries fail to meet EU standards.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said he had discussion with his French counterparts, the FNB, who are very supportive of restricting South American imports.   In the context of the Brexit uncertainty, Angus Woods said the EU should insist that beef is withdrawn from the Mercosur negotiations, which are set to resume in Buenos Aires on March 11th.</p>

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has strongly encouraged suckler farmers to apply for the new €40 per cow BEEP (Beef Environmental and Efficiency Pilot) scheme.</p>
<p>He said the scheme is open for application online at agfood.ie, by post by contacting the Department of Agriculture at 076-1064420.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said the closing date for application is <strong>Friday February 22nd 2019.</strong></p>
<p>The IFA Livestock leader said it is easy to apply for the new BEEP scheme as all it takes is a signature, date and herd number. No other information is required to make the application.</p>
<p>He said IFA fought a hard campaign in the last Budget and secured additional funding of €20m for sucklers and it is very important that farmers apply for the scheme. He said the €40 payment per cow for sucklers is not enough and the IFA are seeking a targeted payment of €200 per cow for sucklers.</p>
<p>In terms of requirements under the scheme, Angus Woods said suckler farmers will be required to weigh their cows and calves once during the year and submit the data to ICBF.</p>
<p>He said the Department of Agriculture will make 400 scales available to farmers through the co-op marts around the country. He said it is essential that costs to farmers for this service are kept to an absolute minimum. In addition, farmers will be able to use their own scales.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said the IFA are campaigning hard to increase the level of targeted direct payments for sucklers. He said as a very low income vulnerable sector Agriculture Minister Michael Creed and the Department will have to deliver a substantial increase in direct supports to sucklers both from national resources and CAP funding.</p>

<p>Speaking at an IFA lobby of TDs and Senators on the beef crisis in Dublin <a href=""http://airmail.calendar/2019-02-13%2012:00:00%20GMT"">today</a>, IFA President Joe Healy said a hard Brexit would devastate Ireland’s €3bn beef and livestock sector. He said, “IFA estimate the imposition of WTO tariffs in a hard-Brexit will impose a direct cost on the beef sector of €800m per year”.</p>
<p><span id=""more-10393""></span></p>
<p>Joe Healy said while the Government and other sectors are talking about preparing for Brexit, beef farmers are already counting their losses. Cattle prices are down €100 per head on this time last year. He said Brexit uncertainty and the weakness of sterling has already hit hard on beef prices and farm incomes.</p>
<p>“The income situation on beef and livestock farms is at crisis point. The latest independent data from Teagasc shows farm incomes are down 16% in 2018 and incomes on cattle are between €10,175 and €15,412.”</p>
<p>IFA representatives from across the country assembled in Dublin today and lobbied TD and Senators from their constituencies on the beef crisis.</p>
<p>The IFA presented a detailed set of proposals including an EU Brexit Emergency Support Package to politicians, demanding that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed take urgent action with the EU Commission to address the Beef and Brexit issues.</p>
<p>The IFA proposals to Government and the EU Commission include;</p>
<ul>
<li>An EU Brexit Emergency Support Package involving a comprehensive set of market supports and direct aid for farmers from the EU Commission</li>
<li>EU state aid limitations on members states must be set-aside</li>
<li>Challenge the meat factories to immediately increase prices and prioritise the young bull kill. Increase factory controls on trim, classification and weights.</li>
<li>Strong support for the live export trade to double numbers in 2019 and ensure that no further restrictions are imposed on the trade</li>
<li>Reward quality suckler stock with a significant price premium</li>
<li>Increased funding for suckler to €200 per cow</li>
<li>Insist on an increase in the CAP budget</li>
<li>Continue to resist a damaging Mercosur trade deal</li>
<li>Climate change recommendations which focus on the Teagasc roadmap with no carbon-based production quota.</li>
</ul>
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said IFA has requested that for every 5c/kg change on the price, Minister Creed needs to secure €20 per head additional direct payment compensation.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said Agriculture Minister Michael Creed and the Government must adopt an urgent approach to the crisis in the beef sector. He said the Minister needs to abandon his ‘wait and see attitude’ and get back out to Brussels to secure an immediate aid package for Brexit beef losses.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said IFA has met with EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan and senior EU Commission officials in Brussels in recent weeks and put forward a strong case for a Brexit aid package for Irish beef.</p>

<p>Following a visit to Cherbourg, France, IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan and Livestock Chairman Angus Woods today (Friday) said there is real scope for increased quality lairage capacity for Irish calf exports in the area.</p>
<p>The two IFA farm leaders called on Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed, his officials and all stakeholders in the sector to engage with their relevant counterparts and partners at national and regional level in France to help make this happen.</p>
<p>“We met with the two lairage operators in Cherbourg, and found their facilities to be of very high standard, professionally run by committed staff using best practice which are being controlled by the regional veterinary authorities whom we also met,” the two Chairmen said.</p>
<p>Tom Phelan added: “At a meeting with the Port Authorities, we established that there is real appetite in the region to develop and support the logistical capacity for all types of export activity, especially in the context of Brexit.  Our meetings with the lairage operators have shown that they like working with Irish calf exporters and are positively disposed towards catering for increased capacity in future”.</p>
<p>Angus Woods added “Our trip was not just about gathering information.  We also wanted to give justified confidence to the local lairage operators, veterinary and Port authorities that the export of calves in best practice conditions out of Ireland was a sustainable trade flow which, while highly seasonal, would see a steady increase and justify continued and additional investment in facilities”.</p>
<p>The National Livestock Chairman added: “For calves just as for weanlings or other stock, the live export trade is a crucial component of the market, providing essential price competition and additional outlets. Securing increased capacity is very important for this valuable trade.”</p>
<p>In 2018, Ireland exported a total of 246,000 live cattle, of which 158,000 were calf exports. The main calf export markets included Spain (92,495), Netherlands (48,922) and Belgium (13,459).</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy said the IFA will hold an intensive lobby of all TDs and Senators on the beef crisis in Dublin next Wednesday, February 13th. He said the crisis is due to multiple factors including poor prices, rising costs and reduced direct payments. This has been compounded by the weakness of sterling and the major uncertainty around Brexit.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said compared to this time last year, cattle prices are down by 20/25 cents per kg or €100/head. Cattle finishers with young bulls are facing price cuts of 40c/kg+ and finding it almost impossible to sell their stock.</p>
<p>The IFA President said urgent action is required now by the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed and the government to ensure the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>A comprehensive package of market supports and direct aid for farmers from the EU Commission<br>
EU state aid limitations on members states must be set-aside<br>
Strong support for the live export trade to double numbers in 2019 and ensure that no further restrictions are imposed on the trade<br>
Increased funding for suckler cows<br>
Continue to resist a damaging Mercosur trade deal<br>
Insist on an increase in the CAP budget, and<br>
Challenge the meat factories to immediately increase prices and prioritise the young bull kill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p></blockquote>
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said R3 grade young bulls in Ireland are reported at €3.71/kg for w/e Jan 19th.</p>
<p>“Compared to young bull prices across the main EU markets we are way behind with the Italian price at €4.55/kg inclusive vat, the German price at €4.05/kg, French bulls at €4.02/kg and the Spanish price at €3.98/kg,” said the IFA National Livestock Chairman.</p>
<p>“These figures indicate that Irish young bull producers are being short changed by up to 30c/kg compared to our European counterparts,” he said.<br>
The IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said, “We made it very clear to Minister Creed at the IFA AGM last week that he must reconsider his approach, abandon his ‘wait and see attitude’ and get back out to Brussels to secure an immediate aid package for Brexit beef losses”.<br>
Angus Woods said he met with senior EU Commission officials from DG Agri in Brussels last week and put forward a strong case for a Brexit aid package for Irish beef. In addition, he said IFA also met with senior officials in the Department of Agriculture on EU supports.<br/>

IFA President Joe Healy said the IFA will hold an intensive lobby of all TDs and Senators on the beef crisis in Dublin next Wednesday, February 13th. He said the crisis is due to multiple factors including poor prices, rising costs and reduced direct payments. This has been compounded by the weakness of sterling and the major uncertainty around Brexit.
Joe Healy said compared to this time last year, cattle prices are down by 20/25 cents per kg or €100/head. Cattle finishers with young bulls are facing price cuts of 40c/kg+ and finding it almost impossible to sell their stock.
The IFA President said urgent action is required now by the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed and the government to ensure the following:
A comprehensive package of market supports and direct aid for farmers from the EU Commission
EU state aid limitations on members states must be set-aside
Strong support for the live export trade to double numbers in 2019 and ensure that no further restrictions are imposed on the trade
Increased funding for suckler cows
Continue to resist a damaging Mercosur trade deal
Insist on an increase in the CAP budget, and
Challenge the meat factories to immediately increase prices and prioritise the young bull kill.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said R3 grade young bulls in Ireland are reported at €3.71/kg for w/e Jan 19th.
“Compared to young bull prices across the main EU markets we are way behind with the Italian price at €4.55/kg inclusive vat, the German price at €4.05/kg, French bulls at €4.02/kg and the Spanish price at €3.98/kg,” said the IFA National Livestock Chairman.
“These figures indicate that Irish young bull producers are being short changed by up to 30c/kg compared to our European counterparts,” he said.
The IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said, “We made it very clear to Minister Creed at the IFA AGM last week that he must reconsider his approach, abandon his ‘wait and see attitude’ and get back out to Brussels to secure an immediate aid package for Brexit beef losses”.
Angus Woods said he met with senior EU Commission officials from DG Agri in Brussels last week and put forward a strong case for a Brexit aid package for Irish beef. In addition, he said IFA also met with senior officials in the Department of Agriculture on EU supports.
He said IFA has requested that for every 5c/kg change on the price, Minister Creed needs to secure €20 per head additional direct payment compensation.

<p>With spring calving now underway on many Irish farms, IFA Health and Safety Executive William Shortall has urged farmers to be particularly vigilant to ensure their own safety.</p>
<p>An average, 9% of farm fatalities are caused by cow and heifer attacks each year, with farmers more vulnerable to accidents at this time of year due to tiredness brought on by the heavy workload of spring. This is compounded by the fact that heifers and cows can be unpredictable at calving time and may hit out without warning.</p>
<p>According to IFA Health and Safety Executive William Shortall, “Spring is the busiest time of year on many Irish farms. Farmers work around the clock, often needing to be up several times a night to check on animals. This can lead to severe tiredness, restricting a farmers ability to react quickly.”</p>
<p>The IFA has developed some useful tips for farmers to help keep them safe, including:</p>
<p>•               Don’t be afraid to ask for help from a neighbour with a difficult cow or calving<br>
•               Know your limitations, you’re not as agile as you were this time last year<br>
•               Make sure the calving gate is operating properly<br>
•               Make sure the calving jack and ropes are fit for purpose<br>
•               Make sure all dogs and children are out of sight before entering the pen<br>
•               Make sure the cow is correctly locked into the calving gate<br>
•               Ensure calving pens have appropriate lighting<br>
•               Remember there is no such thing as a quite cow</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p> </p>
<p>With the new €40 per cow BEEP (Beef Environmental and Efficiency Pilot) scheme for sucklers open, IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods strongly encouraged suckler farmers to apply for the new scheme and draw down the €40 per cow payment. The application period runs from February 4<sup>th</sup> to February 22<sup>nd</sup>.</p>
<p><span id=""more-10332""></span></p>
<p>He said IFA fought a hard campaign in the last Budget and secured additional funding of €20m for sucklers and it is very important that farmers apply for the scheme. He said the €40 payment for sucklers is not enough and the IFA is determined to continue the campaign to get targeted payments up to €200 per cow for sucklers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods said the application process for the scheme is very simple and just requires farmers to sign the form and submit it to the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods said suckler farmers will have to weigh their cows and calves once during the year, between March 8<sup>th</sup> and November 1<sup>st</sup> 2019, and submit the data to ICBF. Payment will be made in respect of suckler calves born on the holding between July 1<sup>st</sup> 2018 and June 30<sup>th</sup> 2019.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He said the Department of Agriculture will make 400 scales available to farmers through co-op marts around the country. He said it is essential that costs to farmers for this service are kept to an absolute minimum. In addition, farmers will be able to use their own scales.</p>

<p>Suckler farmers do not have to be participating in the BDGP scheme to qualify for BEEP.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods said the IFA is campaigning hard to increase the level of targeted direct payments for sucklers.

<p>IFA’s Health and Safety Executive, William Shortall has urged farmers to take safety precautions when undertaking the spreading of slurry. As of yesterday (13 January) farmers in certain areas of the country are able to commence spreading. The main hazards associated with slurry are toxic slurry gas, slurry tank and lagoon openings and the slurry spreader PTO shaft.</p>
<p>“Spreading slurry is potentially one of the most hazardous activities that a farmer undertakes. The two main risks that present are drowning and gas poisoning. We are urging farmers not to take unnecessary risks and follow simple steps to ensure their own safety and that of their animals,” said William Shortall.</p>
<p>Steps farmers should take include;</p>
<p>•	Make sure all children and pets are kept secure and away from the farmyard<br>
•	Only agitate on a windy day<br>
•	Open all shed doors and shutters to allow airflow through the shed being agitated<br>
•	After starting agitating leave the area for 30 min to allow slurry gases to dissipate<br>
•	Recover agitating points when not in use</br></br></br></br></p>

<p>At a meeting between the IFA and the main live exporters in Portlaoise this week, IFA President Joe Healy said the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed needs to prioritise the live trade in order to achieve a doubling in export numbers in 2019.</p>
<p>“A strong live export trade is absolutely essential for price competition in the cattle trade and for providing major market outlets, especially for calves and weanlings”.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said the exporters highlighted a number of key issues for the live trade which must be addressed by Minister Creed and the Department of Agriculture. He said maximising ferry and lairage capacity is key to meeting the export supply and demand for calves this year.</p>
<p>The exporters made it very clear that any reduction in the current 29-day assembly period for the live trade would be very damaging to the sector. Joe Healy said, “IFA has made it very clear to Minister Creed that he cannot allow the EU restrict Irish live exports to the EU single market and under no circumstances can he accept any reduction in the 29-day period”.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said the exporters also raised issues regarding access to Turkey and the need to make more progress on our disease status.<br>
IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said live exports reached 246,000 head in 2018, of which 158,000 were calves. Weanlings and stores made up 64,000 head and adult cattle 24,000.</br></p>
<p>The main live export market was Spain, taking over 92,000 head followed by the Netherlands at 46,000. Over 24,000 head of weanlings were exported to Italy and 16,600 calves were sent to Belgium.</p>
<p>He said for 2019, Minister Creed needs to be looking at doubling the number of live exports.</p>
<p>IFA Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan said with the existing ferry from Rosslare and the new ferry from Dublin, from March 20th, ferry capacity will be significantly increased this year. “It is essential to increase calf exports in line with the increase in dairy cow numbers, and to optimise lairage capacity by having the ferry sailings on alternate days.”</p>
<p>Joe Healy said Agriculture Minister Michael Creed must continue to strongly support the live trade and insist that there are no restrictions imposed. He said every effort must be made to maximise live export numbers.</p>
<p>In addition, he said it is vital that the live trade continues to operate to the highest animal welfare and health standards.</p>

<p>Addressing the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture today (Tues), IFA President Joe Healy said of the many challenges to the Irish beef sector and our specialised suckler cow sector – Brexit, CAP reform, Mercosur trade negotiations, prices below the cost of production – the biggest single issue is low farm incomes.</p>
<p>The latest Teagasc data for 2018 shows average farm income of only €10,175 for cattle rearing, down 19%. This is not sustainable and we need a much stronger and more supportive Government policy for the suckler cow sector.</p>
<p>As part of the IFA campaign to secure additional targeted direct payments of €200 per suckler cow, we retained the services of the eminent agricultural economist, Professor Thia Hennessey, Head of the Cork University Business School in University College Cork.</p>
<p>Professor Hennessy and her team undertook a full assessment and overview of the suckler beef sector and produced a comprehensive report in August 2018 entitled The Economic and Societal Importance of the Irish Suckler Beef Sector.</p>
<p>Among its findings are:</p>
<p>	The beef sector accounts for over one-third of all agricultural output and over 20 percent or €2.6bn of our exports.</p>
<p>	The suckler cow herd of 900,000 is distributed throughout the country, but particularly dominating in the West.</p>
<p>	Suckler cows account for over 80% of cows in the West, with the figure in excess of 90% in some counties.</p>
<p>	77,738 specialist cattle farms spend over €1.5bn annually on agri-inputs, most of which is spent in the local rural economy.</p>
<p>	A €1m increase in the beef sector output would generate a further €2.11m in the wider economy and support an additional 16 jobs. The comparative figure for the agriculture sector more generally is €1.44m.  Previous research has estimated that every €1 of direct payments to cattle farmers supports €4.28 of output in the wider economy.</p>
<p>	Suckler farmers contribute to wider societal sustainability, particularly as they are often located in marginal or economically disadvantaged areas, where their presence is vital to the social fabric and cultural capital.</p>
<p>	They produce public goods such as protection of the environment and biodiversity and the preservation of the landscape and unique features such as stonewalls and hedgerows all of which positively contribute to the image of rural Ireland and rural tourism.</p>

<p>IFA Livestock farmers from around the country are holding a sit-in protest in the offices of the Minister for Agriculture in Dublin over the refusal of Minister Creed to name the meat factories found guilty of excessively trimming carcases. In addition, the IFA also called on Minister Creed to reject new proposals that could put further restrictions on the important live export trade.</p>
<p><span id=""more-10184""></span></p>
<p>IFA President Joe Healy said, “By refusing to name the offenders involved, Minister Creed is protecting the factories. This is a cover up and it must be exposed.”</p>
<p>Joe Healy said the statement by Minister Creed to the Dail last week on the factories caught over-trimming carcasses was pathetic and failed utterly to recognise the gravity of the issue.</p>
<p>The IFA President said moves by the EU Commission to restrict the vitally important live export trade could have devastating consequences for the cattle trade and price competition. He said, “Minister Creed must reject outright this attempt to tighten the noose on the live trade. This might suit the factories but live exports are critical in providing increased price competition to counteract the cartel like behaviour of meat factories.”<br>
Under new EU rules it is proposed to cut the assembly period for exporters from the current 29 days to only 14 days. Joe Healy said this could have devastating consequences for our important live export trade and must be rejected.<br>
“The Minister must face down the EU bureaucrats and tell them that this change will not be accepted by Ireland. As an island nation we already have additional challenges to get cattle to the continent.”</br></br></p>
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said, “What the factories were found out doing were not ‘mistakes’ as the Minister called them, they are offences under the law. Farmers certainly should be repaid as the Minister ‘understands’ the factories have now apparently ‘accepted’. This pathetic response from the Minister and factories shows contempt for farmers.”<br>
Angus Woods said, “The Minister should stop covering up for the factories and publish the names of the offenders immediately. While the current inspection regime maybe changing in the New Year, the €200 fine currently in place is derisory and is not a sufficient deterrent. The Minister needs to impose much bigger fines and have a policy of naming and shaming all offenders.”</br></p>
<p>“The Minister needs to come out from under the shadow of the factories and move immediately to name the 19 offenders for this year and the 28 offenders from 2016. It is totally unacceptable that this information is being covered up,” he said.</p>
<p>“In addition, it is baffling that the Department inspections would find 28 offences in 2016 and 19 so far in 2018, but he has reported that no violations were found in 2017 or 2015. The Minister needs to tell us how this can be explained,” he said.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said the factories have been lobbying hard against any change by the Department on monitoring of carcase trim for some time as it is clear the current unsatisfactory set up suits them, and not farmers.</p>
<p>“The time for cosy chats with the factories is over. The Minister needs to ensure that the new inspection system is up and running and that all carcasses are being properly monitored by the Department,” he said.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said, “It is not acceptable that the Department are only proposing to monitor 5% of carcases on the line. It is the Ministers responsibility to ensure that farmers are paid the full value for their stock and this means that the carcase classification, carcase trim and weights must be 100% accurate all of the time. There is no room for error on this. This means constant monitoring of all the carcase before the scales by the Department and not just looking at a sample of carcases.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>IFA met with Minister Michael Creed yesterday where the Department of Agriculture told the IFA that the figures for fines for excessive carcase trim in the factories was 19 so far in 2018, zero for 2017, 28 for 2016 and zero for 2015.</p>

IFA met with Minister Michael Creed yesterday where the Department of Agriculture told the IFA that the figures for fines for excessive carcase trim in the factories was 19 so far in 2018, zero for 2017, 28 for 2016 and zero for 2015.

Joe Healy says that these figures were bizarre.  The Minister must come clean on what is going on with the inspection system and name the factories.

<p>IFA President Joe Healy said there is a responsibility on Minister for Agriculture, Michael Creed to release the names of the meat factory plants which have been fined for breaching regulations on carcase trim. “Farmers have long suspected that this practice was going on. Now, we find that 21 separate cases were uncovered this year with factories being fined a derisory amount of €200 for each offence. The Minister has to publish the list of the offenders immediately.”</p>
<p>Joe Healy said that the fine should be increased, immediately, to the maximum allowable under the legislation of €5,000. Factories who continue to break the rules should be prosecuted through the courts with custodial sentences for repeat offenders.</p>
<p>“The IFA Livestock Committee has campaigned hard to get Minister Creed to introduce enhanced supervision of the trimming process by Department of Agriculture AOs in factories.</p>
<p>“The time for slaps on the wrist has come and gone. We need a serious deterrent to ensure factories don’t rob farmers on the trim,” he said.</p>
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the IFA has secured agreement that Agriculture Officers from the Department will now be supervising carcass trim on behalf of farmers in the meat plants on an ongoing constant basis. He said the new arrangements have already commenced on a pilot basis in some meat plants and will be rolled out in full to all meat plants in January 2019.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said the EU regulations on carcase trim is clear and states ‘no fat, muscle or other tissue may be removed from the carcass before weighing, classifying and marking, except for cases when veterinary requirements are applied’.</p>
<p>The National Livestock Chairman said IFA is also demanding that this positive move is extended to cover monitoring and closer controls on carcase classification, weights and the provision of an independent appeals system.</p>

<p>Chairing the EU Commission Civil Dialogue Group on Beef in Brussels, IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the Committee worked through a number of critically important issue for Irish beef and livestock farmers at the meeting.</p>
<p><span id=""more-10105""></span></p>
<p>The main items addressed at the meeting included cattle prices; imports/exports; CAP 2020 proposals and direct payments; EU import standards and Brazil; trade negotiations including Mercosur and the USA; and Brexit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods said the EU Commission presented a very detailed analysis of the EU beef market, highlighting the market difficulties from increased slaughter numbers related to the drought across the EU during the summer. Total EU production for 2018 is up 2%, with heifer output up 7.7% and cows up 3.9%.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He said the prospects and forecast for 2019 are more positive with reduced production and a more stable market and price environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IFA made a strong case on the need for cattle prices to increase as the income situation on farms is not sustainable with prices currently below the costs of production. The importance of a strong live export trade to Turkey was emphasised.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The details of the CAP 2020 proposals were outlined to the meeting with the EU Commission DG Agriculture recognising how important direct payments are to livestock farm incomes. The IFA highlighted the damage to livestock farm incomes from the cuts to direct payments under the Ciolos reforms, saying ‘there can be no cuts to direct payments for livestock farmers under the Hogan reforms’. IFA made it very clear that the CAP Budget must be increased.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the EU Commission meeting, Angus Woods said the IFA raised the failure of Brazil to meet EU standards on the control of residues and contaminants in beef including the controls on veterinary products. He said the recent report from the vets in the European Food and Veterinary Office has stated the Brazilian ‘competent authorities are not in a position to reliably certify that the guarantees required by the relevant export certificates are complied with’. In practice, Angus Woods said this means that the EU Commission cannot rely on Brazilian certification of beef exports to the EU market.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods said on the Mercosur trade negotiations, the IFA raised the lack of coherence between the EU CAP policy and EU trade policy. He said the Commission strategy of increasing beef imports against the backdrop of Brexit and poor beef prices was fundamentally flawed and would seriously undermine the production base, especially the suckler cow herd.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Brexit, Angus Woods said the meeting concluded on the critical need for stability on beef and a positive outcome to the negotiations. He said the view of the meeting was for a longer transition period and a backstop.</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy said farmers are demanding a strong and immediate increase in beef prices.</p>
<p>He said beef farmers have been short-changed on the price this Autumn and its high time the factories restored some confidence to the beef sector and increased prices. These were the strong messages the IFA President delivered to Meat Industry Ireland (MII) leaders at a meeting with the IFA in Dublin this week.</p>
<p>Joe Healy told MII that livestock farmers need to see beef prices at the factories move up to at least €4.00/kg. He said cattle farmers have come through a horrendous year with incomes on the floor and its time the meat factories stopped profiteering on the back of farmers.</p>
<p>He said there is rising anger among farmers with the way the factories cut beef prices this autumn and continued to hold prices down at loss-making levels, despite strong returns from our main export market in the UK.</p>
<p>The IFA leader said with the increased demand for the Christmas trade and the strength of the UK market, factories can pay more.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said cattle prices in our main export market in the UK were at £3.73/kg for R3 grade steers, which is the equivalent of €4.42/kg. He said the price gap between Irish and UK prices has now widened to €200 per head, which shows that the factories are not returning a fair market price to farmers and could pay a lot more.</p>

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/targeted-support-for-sucklers-identified-as-key-food-wise-proposal-for-minister-creed-ifa/,‘Targeted Support for Sucklers’ Identified as Key Food Wise Proposal for Minister Creed – IFA,13 November 2018,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>Tackling the major problem of low incomes on cattle farms must become the key livestock policy focus for the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed under <em>Food Wise 2025,</em> according to IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods. “Minister Creed has to change the focus of Food Wise on livestock, away from more exports for factories to fair incomes for farmers.”</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock leader was speaking following the submission of the Food Wise High Level Meats Group report to Minister Creed by the Chairman Michael Dowling.</p>
<p>Angus Woods welcomed the key issue on beef identified by all stakeholders as ‘introducing targeted support for sucklers’ in line with IFA policy. He said the Group accepted such measures, in addition to providing income support, should be clearly geared towards bringing environment and welfare quality benefits. The Group also considered the introduction of adding a welfare criterion under some form of enhanced BDGP scheme.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said the Food Wise group stressed that beef from the suckler herd is of ‘critical importance for the international marketability of Irish beef abroad and for the health and viability of the rural economy in large parts of the country’.  It stressed, however, that very low profitability will inevitably lead to a sharp drop in suckler output which will undermine the prospect of it making a viable contribution to the Foodwise ambitions for this sector.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock leader said the Food Wise group also made some recommendations about improving the quality of dairy bred beef, genomic verification, grass fed beef and generational change.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said Brexit was identified as the main challenge across all the meat sectors of beef, sheep, pig meat and poultry. Brexit uncertainty should also necessitate the adoption of defensive positions in relation to EU trade deals with Mercusor, Australia and New Zealand, according to industry.  He said for sustainability at farm level, it is essential to secure beef prices above the cost of production and protect and maintain direct supports under CAP and the farm schemes.</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy said cattle prices are rising with some farmers securing a base price of €3.80/kg for steers and €3.90/kg for heifers in recent days. He said with the strength of the UK cattle price and significant positive moves on the sterling exchange rate, it’s clear the factories can pay a lot more.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said increased demand for the Christmas trade is about to kick in and factories are trying to pin down numbers. He said farmers must demand and insist on a strong price increase as the market can pay it.</p>
<p>The IFA President called on the factories to immediately increase prices by another 10c/kg and pass back the improvements in the UK market prices and positive changes to sterling.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said the loss-making prices from the factories over recent weeks have inflicted serious damage on Irish livestock farmers and the beef sector.</p>

IFA President Joe Healy said cattle prices are rising with some farmers securing a base price of €3.80/kg for steers and €3.90/kg for heifers in recent days. He said with the strength of the UK cattle price and significant positive moves on the sterling exchange rate, it’s clear the factories can pay a lot more.
Joe Healy said increased demand for the Christmas trade is about to kick in and factories are trying to pin down numbers. He said farmers must demand and insist on a strong price increase as the market can pay it.
The IFA President called on the factories to immediately increase prices by another 10c/kg and pass back the improvements in the UK market prices and positive changes to sterling.
Joe Healy said the loss-making prices from the factories over recent weeks have inflicted serious damage on Irish livestock farmers and the beef sector.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the new €20m funding for suckler farmers announced in this week’s Budget was recognition of the income crisis in the sector, but the level of funding was disappointing and more needs to be done to help sustain the suckler herd.</p>
<p><span id=""more-9916""></span></p>
<p>He said it was essential that the measures under the new Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP) were kept simple, farmer friendly and do not involve unnecessary costs.<br>
He said the understanding is that the BEEP will be a new scheme, separate from the BDGP and the main measures will involve the recording of data on weights for cows and calves. He said the full details and how they will be implemented have to be worked out with the Department and it was essential that there was full consultation.<br>
Angus Woods said the increased ANC funding of €23m, to bring the allocation to €250m, was positive and reverses the cuts imposed on the lowest income farmers in previous budgets.

He said IFA believe strongly in the importance of the suckler cow sector and will continue to campaign hard for increased supports. Angus Woods pointed out that a recent report commissioned by the IFA from Professor Thia Hennessey from UCC highlighted that 80% of the cows in the West are sucklers and a 10% reduction in suckler cow numbers would result in a €305m reduction in economic output across rural areas.<br>

<p>Addressing the IFA protest outside the Beef Forum today (Wed), IFA President Joe Healy said Minister Creed must stop telling everyone what he cannot do and act now to save beef farmers.</p>
<p><span id=""more-9896""></span></p>
<p>“Under the Minister’s Chairmanship, the Forum has become a mudguard for inaction. It isn’t even a talking shop. Recent meetings have become ‘death by powerpoint’ as farmers get presentation after presentation designed to run down the clock. There is no real engagement on the key issues,” he said.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said “The Minister hasn’t lifted a finger while the factories have robbed farmers by systematically cutting cattle prices.  At the same time, prices to farmers are rising in our main export market in the UK.”</p>
<p>He said that while Minister Creed was trying to wash his hands in relation to beef prices he has no excuse next Tuesday in the Budget. He must show beef farmers that he is on their side by providing additional support for the Suckler sector.</p>
<p>“Budget Day will be the acid test for Minister Creed. Beef Farmers will judge him on what he delivers for sucklers.”</p>
<p>“We’ve had enough of the Minister’s ‘can’t do it, won’t do it’ approach. It won’t wash with farmers. It’s time for action, it’s time for delivery. Next Tuesday is D-Day”.</p>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said farmers are furious with the Minister’s indifference to the income crisis on livestock farms. “We asked the Minister to tackle the factories when they took advantage of farmers on cattle prices during the drought. We presented a detailed report to him at the Tullamore Show on sucklers, which shows that a 10% reduction in suckler cow numbers will hit economic output in rural areas by €305m”.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said Minister Creed needs to be the Minister for Agriculture and to stand up for farmers, and not be the Minister for factories. “Minister Creed seems to be fixated on driving beef exports, with the gains going to the factories on the back of loss-making prices to farmers.”</p>
<p>He said the income pressure on cattle farms was at breaking point, following the severe weather conditions all year and the massive increase in costs. He said the way the factories have cut prices over recent weeks is ‘the straw that broke the camel’s back’. The Teagasc National Farm survey data shows that for 2017, the average income on cattle rearing farms was only €12,529.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said “Factories have torn the hell out of prices and forced them down well below the cost of production. This also eroded confidence in the market place and wrecked the mart price for weanlings and stores. Prices in our main export market in the UK are rising, up 20p/kg in recent weeks”.</p>

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods accused the cattle factories of crippling cattle farmers financially with their obsession to cut beef prices and swell  their own pockets.

<p>Angus Woods pointed out that cattle prices in our main export market in the UK had increased by 4p/kg per week for the last 3 weeks and he contrasted this with prices cuts from the Irish factories. He said the factory pull on beef prices is inflicting massive damage on the weanling and store cattle trade in the marts across the country and undermining the suckler cow herd. He said the trade was already under severe pressure from the drought and fodder situation but the factory price cuts had ripped confidence out of the trade.</p>
<p>The IFA National Livestock leader said this year farmers have had to endure an extremely long and severe winter/spring period with massive meal bills. On top of this the drought involved farmers having to feed meals on grass at very significant additional expense and all of these bills are still there to be paid.</p>
<p>Angus Woods pointed out that cattle prices in our main export market are £3.76/kg(w/e Sept 1st), which is the equivalent of €4.40/kg. “Prices in the UK have increased every week from early August, rising from £3.63/kg to £3.76/kg, a price increase equivalent to 15c/kg.</p>
<p>At the same time Irish factories have cut the prices.

<p>With EU Commission officials in Montevideo in Uruguay this week to reconvene the Mercosur trade talks, IFA President Joe Healy said the time has come for EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan put his foot down and tell Trade Commissioner Malmstrom enough is enough.<span id=""more-9840""></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joe Healy said, “With major uncertainty over Brexit and only contempt being shown by Brazil in their failure to meet EU standards on imports, the time has come for Commission Hogan to shout stop on Mercosur”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joe Healy said EU Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan must deliver on their commitment to put Ireland first in Brexit and ensure that there is no Mercosur deal on beef while Brexit remains unsorted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The IFA President said the Mercosur negotiations lack credibility and are taking place against a background where there are major political scandals and unrest in Brazil and economic meltdown in Argentina. He said these are the big two Mercosur member states the EU are relying on to pull off a deal. “Elections are set to take place in Brazil in October against a background of massive political corruption, deep economic recession and rising unrest”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The IFA President said the economic collapse in Argentina has seen the currency devalue in the last 12 months from 20.25 ARS to the €uro down to 44.98 ARS last week. This is a devaluation of 125% and shows how ludicrous it would be for the EU to agree to any type of a trade deal with such an unstable economy. He said with this type of devaluation Argentina could flood the EU with cheap substandard beef and other agricultural products. In addition he said the Brazilian real (BRL) has devalued by 33% from 3.68 to 4.90 against the €uro in the last year and the Uruguayan Peso (UYU) has devalued by 12% from 33.80 to 37.80 to the €uro.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said, “In view of the lack of progress on Brexit and our critical dependence on the UK market for beef exports, the EU cannot agree to increased beef imports from Mercosur.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods said removing the UK market in Brexit will leave the EU beef market 116% self-sufficient.  “Increasing EU beef imports makes no sense whatsoever and the EU Commission should instruct Commissioner Malmstrom to withdraw beef from the Mercosur negotiations,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods said Irish and EU beef farmers are also very concerned over reports of the EU Commission allocating more of the existing hormone free beef quota to the US. He said the question has to be asked what political promises are being made to other countries such as the Mercosur block or Australia for an increase in their quotas to accommodate this move with the US.</p>

<p>The National Livestock Chairman said IFA is also demanding that this positive move is extended to cover monitoring and closer controls on carcase classification, weights and the provision of an independent appeals system.</p>

In response to the demand from the IFA for Department AOs to monitor trim the Minister said “The Veterinary Public Health Inspection staff in conjunction with the Beef Carcase Classification section are currently putting in place a training and reporting system to facilitate the monitoring of carcase presentation by Technical officers permanently based in the Meat factories.”
The National Livestock Chairman said IFA is also demanding that this positive move is extended to cover monitoring and closer controls on carcase classification, weights and the provision of an independent appeals system.

<p>While visiting a number of drought-hit farms in the South East today, IFA President Joe Healy said that Minister Michael Creed needs to deliver real measures to help farmers on the ground.<span id=""more-9756""></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Today’s announcement by EU Commissioner Phil Hogan to allow a 70% advance payment under the Basic Payment Scheme is welcome, however the benefit of this will not be seen until October 16<sup>th” </sup>he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“While the derogation for the production of animal feed on fallow land is also welcome, other important flexibilities are required under the GLAS scheme which would be of much greater assistance. IFA estimates that up to 100,000 ha of additional land could be brought into fodder production by granting flexibilities for catch crops, fallow land and low input grassland under GLAS.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The Government must also explore the additional flexibility available under state aid rules to support farmers at this extremely difficult time” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“As a matter of urgency, Minister Creed must now clarify what exact measures he has sought and is seeking from Brussels. It is reported in today’s <em>Farmers Journal</em> that no formal request has been submitted by the Minister for a number of derogations that are needed under the GLAS scheme to help farmers to save more fodder before the winter” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Farmers also need more flexibility on fertiliser application rules to allow them to maximise grass growth in the next few months” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The drought is still affecting many parts of the country, with minimal grass growth and significant impacts on spring cereals and vegetables. There are now huge feed bills on many dairy and livestock farms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If the rain continues to fall, farmers may have a narrow window to maximise grass growth and save as much fodder as possible. EU restrictions which limit this must be lifted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What we asking for is that farmers are allowed to help themselves. We have a chronic fodder shortage and if we don’t act now it will too late” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The IFA President again called on Minister Creed to introduce immediately the low cost loans which were promised in last October’s Budget, adding that these loans must be available for working capital.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Many farmers have now run up huge debts with their co-ops and merchants purchasing additional feed. Opening up the low costs loans would make available over €150m in liquidity for farmers which would help to pay feed and other bills.” Joe Healy concluded.</p>

<p>Joe Healy warned the factories to stop price cutting and undermining the beef market. He said over the last 4 weeks, prices have been cut by 20c/kg or up to €80 per head, which is the profit margin in most cases.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said Agriculture Minister Michael Creed needs to get tough with the factories and demand they stop the unnecessary price rot.

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the latest report from DG Sante proves that Brazil is still failing to meet EU standards on beef.<span id=""more-9601""></span></p>
<p>He said the FVO report is very clear in highlighting the fact that Brazil is in total breach of EU regulations by allowing factory staff carry out post-mortem inspections for beef exported into Europe. He said this would be illegal in the EU.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said the EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Vytenis Andriukaitis cannot allow the Commission to continue to ‘bury their heads in the sand and ignore the findings of their vets on the failures of Brazil to meet EU standards’.</p>
<p>In addition, he said this report should be another wake-up call for Commissioner Malmstrom to immediately withdraw beef from the Mercosur negotiations.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said the FVO reports states that out of the 53 beef plants cleared for export to the EU, the Brazilians have only 187 official veterinary staff and 761 factory staff performing post-mortem inspections for beef exports to Europe. The report also highlights that these staff are paid directly by the factories, many which were involved in the high profile Weak Flesh corruption scandal last year.</p>
<p>The FVO report also highlights the breach in EU regulations in Brazil over their failure to properly de-list non-compliant meat plants.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said this latest report from Brazil is a follow up on the 2017 FVO report which exposed the failure of the official controls on beef by Brazilian authorities.</p>

Farmers should insist on payment on the day for their cattle



"
https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/minister-creed-must-challenge-factories-directly-on-price-cuts-ifa/,Minister Creed Must Challenge Factories Directly on Price Cuts – IFA,25 June 2018,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the meat factories are up to their usual seasonal undermining of the beef price in a very concerted and damaging way.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said at this early stage the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed should immediately call in the key factory players and challenge them directly over their actions.  “The Minister has invested heavily in the beef processing sector in terms of market access over the last two years and made considerable progress. He cannot allow the factories throw all of this work back in his face with constant weekly price cuts that are not justified by market changes.”</p>
<p><span id=""more-9572""></span></p>
<p>Angus Woods said factories are currently paying a base of €4.10/kg for steers and €4.20/kg for heifers, but are quoting less for later in the week. However, demand remains strong with plants anxious for cattle. He said with the good weather farmers are busy and thrive is very good.</p>
<p>In our main export market in the UK, Angus Woods reported that slaughterings continue to tighten and prices continue to rise. For the week ending June 16<sup>th</sup>, prices rose by another 1.3p/kg with the R3 steer price at £3.80/kg, equivalent to €4.55/kg incl vat. He said the AHDB reported that the continued upward price trend recorded over the past few weeks indicates current market conditions have been in the producer’s favour; the all-prime average has strengthened by 16p/kg in the past four months.</p>
<p>The IFA livestock leader said cattle supplies will remain tight for the next number of weeks and the forecast for the second half of 2018 is very similar to last year. He said the latest figures from the Department of Agriculture AIMS data show that as of April 1<sup>st</sup> male cattle numbers in the 12 to 24- month age category are down 25,000 head compared to last year, and up 23,000 head in the 24 to 36-month age group.</p>
<p>He said with the kill up over 20,000 head to date this year, a large number of this older group could already be sold. On the female beef cattle side, he said there was an additional 7,000 in the 24 to 36-month age group and an extra 21,000 in the 12 to 24-month age category.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said the recent EU Beef Forecast Group meeting in Brussels is predicting a more positive outlook on beef and have revised their figures to show a contraction in production for 2018 by -0.4% and have also forecasted an increase in consumption by +0.3%. He said this is a positive turnaround for the sector. The EU is forecasting male bovines will increase in price by +1.3% and cow prices will increase by +3.8%.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock leader said the good news on live exports is very welcome and it was positive to see exporters active in the trade to Libya and also Turkey. He said the potential for the live export trade to move more young bulls and heifers this year looks positive.</p>

IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the meat factories are up to their usual seasonal undermining of the beef price in a very concerted and damaging way.
Angus Woods said at this early stage the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed should immediately call in the key factory players and challenge them directly over their actions.  “The Minister has invested heavily in the beef processing sector in terms of market access over the last two years and made considerable progress. He cannot allow the factories throw all of this work back in his face with constant weekly price cuts that are not justified by market changes.”

Angus Woods said factories are currently paying a base of €4.10/kg for steers and €4.20/kg for heifers, but are quoting less for later in the week. However, demand remains strong with plants anxious for cattle. He said with the good weather farmers are busy and thrive is very good.

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/positive-news-on-live-exports/,Positive News on Live Exports,12 June 2018,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the live exports trade has performed very positively in 2018 with exports up 25% to 154,650 head.<span id=""more-9505""></span></p>
<p>He said the latest developments on Turkey, clearing the way for private business on live exports, are very positive and should see a strong boost to the trade for the second half of the year. This follows an IFA and Bord Bia visit to the Turkish market late last year.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said it was very clear from the IFA-Bord Bia visit that there is major potential to grow live exports to Turkey. During the trip, IFA met with various Government agencies including the Turkish Meat and Milk Board, ESK, and with a number of private buyers who indicated a strong wish to buy Irish livestock.</p>
<p>The IFA livestock leader said some exporters have already commenced assembling stock under the necessary quarantine arrangements for export to Turkey.</p>
<p>To date this year, more than 8,920 animals have been exported to international markets, the majority to Turkey. A small level of exports have also gone to Libya and Morocco. Angus Woods said there is also potential to export to Egypt, Tunisia and Algeria.</p>
<p>A recent Bord bia visit to Tunisia reported that the Government has given approval for live exports to resume for the first time since 2015. There is a demand to import quality weanlings from Ireland with the specification between 6 to 12 months of age and up to 400kgs.</p>
<p>Live exports to May 20th totalled 154,650 head compared to 123,505 this time last year. The vast majority of exports are calves at 128,700 head and 25,950 adult animals.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said IFA is very supportive of the live export trade which he described as a key driver of competition and provider of essential market outlets.</p>
<p>On payments, Angus Woods said farmers should make sure that their payments are secured and sell through their local registered livestock mart.</p>

Farmers should insist on payment on the day for their cattle



"
https://www.ifa.ie/markets-and-prices/cattle-prices-increase-again-this-week/,Cattle Prices Increase Again This Week,28 May 2018,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said cattle prices are continuing to drive forward with higher base prices of €4.25/kg for steers and €4.35/kg for heifers being paid this week. He said demand remains very strong and, as supplies tighten, prices continue to increase.<span id=""more-9447""></span></p>
<p>Angus Woods said it is very important finishers hold out strongly for price increases at this time as the costs involved in finishing cattle out of the sheds at this time of year are exceptionally high.</p>
<p>The IFA livestock leader said some O grade steers are being bought flat €4.10/kg and P grades at €4.00/kg.</p>

IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said cattle prices are continuing to drive forward with higher base prices of €4.25/kg for steers and €4.35/kg for heifers being paid this week. He said demand remains very strong and, as supplies tighten, prices continue to increase.
Angus Woods said it is very important finishers hold out strongly for price increases at this time as the costs involved in finishing cattle out of the sheds at this time of year are exceptionally high.
The IFA livestock leader said some O grade steers are being bought flat €4.10/kg and P grades at €4.00/kg.
Young bulls are also driving on with €4.20 for R grades and €4.35/kg for U grades.
Angus Woods said cow prices are also strong with top quality U grade cows making €3.90/3.95/kg, R grade cows on €3.85/3.90/kg, O grades at €3.65/kg and P+ on €3.55/kg.
The IFA livestock leader said the official Department of Agriculture average prices paid for week ending May 20th were €4.28/kg for R=3= steers and €4.38/kg for R=3= heifers.

<p>IFA President Joe Healy today (Tues) said the preliminary results of the Teagasc 2017 National Farm Income survey highlighted the critical importance of CAP direct supports across all farming sectors and the dangers of hugely volatile or weak price returns.</p>
<p><span id=""more-9431""></span></p>
<p>Joe Healy said with the major challenges from Brexit and the CAP post-2020, the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed and the Irish Government needed to work twice as hard to secure a positive Brexit outcome and an increase in the CAP budget.</p>
<p>“The increase in average farm income for 2017 to €31,300 comes off the back of a difficult year in 2016.  Farming on the whole remains a low-income activity, with average earnings well below the average industrial wage,” he said.</p>
<p>“The 2017 figure is influenced by the positive performance from dairy farms, the vast majority of which are full time, with higher volumes and better prices after a difficult year in 2016.  It also illustrates the extreme income volatility which challenges dairy farmers: milk prices have been cut by up to 6c/l this year already, and spring volumes have suffered from the bad weather.  EU market supports and voluntary risk management tools, including through national tax-based measures, must be developed to help farmers cope with those sharp swings in cash flow,” he said.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said the Teagasc income figures on livestock clearly demonstrate the dependence of dry stock farmers on direct payments and the need for strong additional support for suckler farmers.

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has called on the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed to come on board with farmers and support the strong case for increased targeted support for the suckler cow herd of €200 per cow.</p>
<p><span id=""more-9435""></span></p>
<p>Angus Woods said figures from the 2017 Teagasc National Farm Income survey released today show that the real problem on suckler farms is low incomes. “The survey shows that the average suckler income is only €12,500.  This clearly demonstrates the need for strong additional support for suckler farmers.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He said Agriculture Minister Michael Creed and the Department cannot continue to ignore the severe income crisis in livestock. “Saying no to proposals to try and improve suckler incomes is not an option.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The IFA livestock leader said suckler farmers are under severe income pressure and cow numbers are falling. The figures from ICBF show that suckler registrations are down by 20,272 to 943,503. Since 2012, overall numbers have fallen by 132,207, which is a 12% reduction from the peak.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Minister Creed is telling farmers that under State Aid rules he cannot pay €200 per cow and he keeps referring to coupled payments and taking money from other farmers”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods said IFA has been to Brussels and the EU Commission is clear that Ireland can make a targeted payment of €200 per cow under the animal welfare option in the CAP Rural Development Plan. In addition, the IFA proposal is not based on taking any money from any other farmer and involves a targeted payment per cow under the CAP Pillar II, financed from additional exchequer funding and RDP savings. “IFA is demanding new money from the Government for this support and flatly reject any suggestions that it would be taken from any farmer’s Basic Payment.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The Minister and the Government are looking at a financial surplus of over €3bn heading into the Budget next October. The resources are there and it a matter of priorities for Minister Creed”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods said the suckler cow herd is the backbone of the Irelands €3bn beef and livestock sector, providing top quality beef to make Ireland the fourth largest beef exporter in the world, with 557,000t exported to over 85 markets worldwide, accounting for 20% of all food exports.  “There are suckler cows in every parish in the country and they are the backbone of the quality Irish beef sector.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A study for IFA by UCD Professor of Agricultural Economics Alan Renwick shows that each €1 of support invested in the beef sector, underpins over €4.38 in output in the Irish economy. At local level, the study showed that the cattle sector is embedded in the local economy, with 80% of cattle output sold in the area and over 90% of inputs sourced in the local area.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angus Woods said the suckler cow sector delivers substantial public goods in terms of jobs, economic output and activity across all rural areas and positive environmental credentials through natural grassland farming with low carbon emissions (fifth lowest in the EU) and high animal welfare standards.</p>

<p>“Brazil does not have the same traceability standards as EU producers” – this was the main conclusion of a report by the European Parliament Committee on Agriculture following a recent visit by a delegation of MEPs from the Committee to Brazil to investigate the beef and poultry industries. <span id=""more-9417""></span></p>
<p>Following visits to farms and meat factories in Brazil, the MEPs concluded that “Brazil does not have the same traceability standards as EU producers”. They found records are only kept of animal lots in factories and, as a result, “meat cannot be traced back to the individual farm from where the animal originated”.</p>
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the reality is that after 20 years of trying, and having been given every opportunity by the EU Commission, Brazil has totally failed to put any type of tagging and movement control system in place to provide basic traceability.</p>
<p>He said the visit by the MEPs to Brazil and mission report highlight that up to 30 Brazilian meat companies have been selling contaminated meat on the export and domestic markets. The reports states, “Sanitary and export certificates were falsified and federal inspectors bribed. The Carne Fraca or Weak Meat scandal led to increased concerns that Brazilian sanitary measures are not up to European standards and the results of the EU Commission’s own analysis through audit reports and SPS checks have raised alarm in relation to meat exports from Brazil.”</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock leader said the latest report from MEPs proves once again that Brazil fails to meet EU standards across all of the critical issues of traceability, food safety, animal health and welfare, environmental and labour controls. He said MEPs must act on this report in Parliament and demand that Trade Commissioner Malmström and Agriculture Commission Hogan withdraw agriculture and especially beef from the current Mercosur negotiations.</p>
<p>“MEPs need to seriously question the credibility of continuing to negotiate with Mercosur when the Commission has absolute proof that Brazil fails to meet EU standards and when the Brazilian administration is subject to serious allegations of corruption and fraud.”</p>
<p>Angus Woods said the members of the European Agriculture Committee met with the Brazilian Agriculture Minister Maggi and raised very serious questions about the use of hormones and the use of antibiotics in beef production. The MEPs also met with the leader of the Brazilian Senate, Senator Romero Juca and raised questions over the lack of sufficient controls on products exported to the EU.</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy is travelling to China today as part of a Ministerial trade mission, following the opening of the Chinese market for Irish beef last month. He is joined by Livestock Chairman Angus Woods and Pigs Chairman Tom Hogan. <span id=""more-9395""></span><br>
Joe Healy said, “With over half of our beef exports currently going to the UK, and Brexit looming large, it has never been more important to diversify and develop our markets and, in that context, China represents a huge opportunity. Securing a breakthrough on market access for Irish beef in April this year was a welcome development and positive news for the sector.”</br></p>
<p>Joe Healy said it is encouraging that Agriculture Minister Michael Creed and EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan are leading these high level trade missions organised around the SIAL Fair in Shanghai China to promote Irish and European food and agriculture.</p>
<p>“China consumes one-quarter of the world’s meat supply, and imported 700,000 tonnes of beef in 2017. There is enormous potential for further rapid growth in consumer demand for beef, with consumption expected to double by 2020, driven by increasing urbanisation and rising incomes.”</p>
<p>Joe Healy said he would be using the trip as an opportunity to highlight the commitment of Irish farmers to producing high quality food to the highest standards, “The Irish agri-food industry has had considerable success in maximising the Chinese market for dairy, positioning Irish produce as a premium product. We hope to see this success replicated for beef.”</p>
<p>The value of Irish food and drink exports to mainland China and Hong Kong has more than doubled since 2013, and reached €907m last year.</p>
<p>“To capture a substantial market share in the Chinese beef market, it is very important that eligibility is secured for all Irish beef products and not just frozen boneless beef. It is essential that the market opportunity is not restrictive and the protocol is developed to allow beef products from all Irish livestock.”</p>
<p>Joe Healy said The Chinese market has become an important market for Irish pigmeat product over the last number of years with exports to China growing to almost €100m in 2017. He said, the opportunity exists to grow this further and to take advantage of the recent Chinese decision to impose tariffs on pork originating in the US.</p>
<p>In addition, dairy exports to China reached €666m in 2017, with infant formula being the major export product. 13% of all infant formula sold in China in 2017 was Irish.</p>

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said cattle prices continue to rise this week with the base price for steers moving up to as high as €4.20/kg and tops of €4.30/kg for heifers.<span id=""more-9387""></span></p>
<p>He said the general run of prices is €4.15/4.25/kg but as factories are very anxious to get tighter supplies more and more feeders are doing deals at the higher base price levels.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said the strong market demand is also reflected in higher cow prices with P and O grade cows making €3.50/kg and R grades up to 3.80/kg. Top U grade cows are on €3.90/kg. In addition he said R and U grade bulls are making €4.20/kg with better prices for all U grades.</p>
<p>The IFA livestock leader said with the kill dropping back to 31,226, prices are continuing to rise. In addition he said cattle prices in the UK are maintaining their upward movement with further increase in the last week. The R3 steer price in the UK for week ended May 5th was £3.74/kg equivalent to €4.47/kg. Angus Woods said demand for beef remains very strong across the UK and EU markets.</p>
<p><strong>Live Exports</strong></p>
<p>Angus Woods said it is very positive that another boat load of heavier bulls is leaving Ireland this week for Turkey. He said this solid trade to Turkey is encouraging. In addition, he said some exporters are starting to put cattle on quarantine to be ready for private contract purchases.</p>
<p>To date this year, live exports are up 18% to over 120,000 head, of which over 100,000 head are calves. In addition, some 6,500 cattle have been exported to Turkey.</p>

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the cattle trade is stronger again this week with prices moving ahead by 5c to 10c/kg, depending on location and also on the category of livestock.<span id=""more-9322""></span></p>
<p>He said the base price for steers has now moved up to €4.05/4.10/kg and for heifers to €4.15/4.20/kg. He said the higher prices of €4.10 and €4.20 appear to be more prevalent in the northern, eastern and western parts of the country.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said cow prices have also increased strongly this week, with some grades up 10c/kg on last week. He said some quality R grade cows are making up to €3.85/kg, with O grades as high as €3.60/kg and P grades on €3.45/kg in places. Young Bull have also increased in price with €4.10/kg available for R grades and €4.20 plus paid for U grades.</p>
<p>At an EU Commission Beef Meeting he chaired in Brussels this week, Angus Woods said there was a more positive tone to prospects for the trade for 2018. The EU Commission is forecasting an increase in consumption of 0.4% and only a very small rise in production of 0.13%. He said the Commission is also forecasting that EU prime beef prices should rise by 1.3% and cow prices look set to increase by 3.83% in 2018. He said all the figures point to a strong recovery and growth in beef consumption across the EU markets with overall EU imports up and exports down for the first two months of 2018.</p>

<p>Speaking from Brussels today, IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said the decision of the EU to ban another 20 Brazilian meat plants because they fail to meet EU standards fully backs up the repeated calls from the IFA to reject any increase in meat imports from Brazil in the Mercosur negotiations.<span id=""more-9303""></span></p>
<p>As another round of the negotiations on Mercosur commences this week in Brussels, Angus Woods said EU Trade Commissioner Malmstrom needs to realise that the Brazilians will continue to fail on standards and she should pull the plug on any additional beef imports in the negotiations.</p>
<p>The IFA Livestock Chairman said the EU Commission is too easy on Brazil and is listening too much to their Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggo, who was in Brussels last week lobbying heavily for increased imports of substandard beef and poultry.<br>
Angus Woods said Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom is extremely naive to believe that the Brazilians are going to conform to the rules in any Mercosur trade agreement with the EU, especially with regard to meeting EU standards on beef or other meat imports. He said it is clear Commissioner Malmstrom is out of her depth in these negotiations and the Brazilians are pulling the wool over her eyes on the critical issue of standards.</br></p>
<p>He said the record speaks for itself; EU audits show that for the last 18 years the Brazilians have consistently failed to meet EU standards on the critical issues of traceability, food safety, animal and plant health, environmental and labour standards.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said, “The Brazilians have thrown away the rule book, the latest example being the major meat scandal and fraud ‘Weak Flesh’ from this time last year, which is still running at the very highest administration and political levels in Brazil.</p>
<p>“The only thing we have seen from Commissioner Malmstrom in these negotiations is giveaway after giveaway of the European meat sector, with little or nothing in return. The Commissioner has already capitulated to the Brazilians in these negotiations, moving from an offer 45,000t to 70,000t and now the Brazilians are looking for way more.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Angus Woods said EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan has to face down the Trade Commissioner and insist that the EU does not give any more concessions to the Brazilians.</p></blockquote>
<p>He accused the Trade Commissioner of blatantly undermining European policy and values on the environment and animal welfare, “One arm of the Commission is prepared to do this deal and undermine the environment and animal welfare, while European farmers are lectured on climate change and maintaining the highest welfare standards.” He said Irish beef production is four times more carbon efficient than Brazil where growth is driven on the back of destruction of the rainforests.</p>
<p>“The negotiating strategy flies in the face of everything that the EU stands for, and what is happening in terms of Brexit. Beef is more important to Ireland than any other EU member state. Commissioner Hogan cannot agree to a Mercosur deal involving a major increase in substandard beef imports from Brazil at the same time as we face into the serious challenges of Brexit.”</p>
<blockquote><p>With Brexit, the EU beef market would be 116% self-sufficient. Angus Woods said to negotiate a trade deal with Mercosur at this time makes no sense whatsoever.</p></blockquote>
<p>IFA Poultry Chairman Andy Boylan warned the European poultry industry must not be used as a pawn in the Mercosur negotiations. He said, “Standards in the poultry production chain in Mercosur nations, especially Brazil, have been proved to be completely substandard and bear no resemblance to the high standard that Irish poultry producers operate to under the Bord Bia Quality Assurance standard.”</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy has welcomed the announcement by Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed that the Chinese market is opening for Irish beef.<span id=""more-9263""></span></p>
<p>Joe Healy said the opening of the Chinese market, after a lot of hard work, presents the beef sector with an opportunity to build on the progress the Irish dairy and pig meat sectors have made in China in recent years. He pointed out that Irish dairy exports reached €670m and pigment exports grew to almost €100m in 2017.</p>
<p>The IFA President said to capture a substantial market share in the Chinese beef market, it is very important that eligibility is secured for all Irish beef products and not just frozen boneless beef and that all export beef plants are cleared. In addition, he said it is essential that the market opportunity is not restrictive and the protocol is developed to allow beef products from all Irish livestock.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said the major challenges for Minister Creed on beef remain the need to take action to improve the unacceptably low income levels on Irish farms and the market challenges arising from Brexit, given that the UK market takes up to 280,000t of our beef exports.</p>

<p>With a further Met Eireann yellow alert situation today, we are in now an emergency situation on fodder and Minister Creed has to implement further measures to support farmers immediately, IFA President Joe Healy has said.<span id=""more-9187""></span></p>
<p>He said the fodder import scheme announced by Minister Creed yesterday evening must be open to all co-ops, licensed merchants and livestock marts. “The Scheme must be inclusive of outlets who serve all farming sectors and all regions of the country,” he said.</p>
<p>“The Minister’s attempt to resuscitate his National transport scheme by reducing the minimum distance fodder has to travel from 100k to 50km before it will be eligible for a subsidy will not work. He should stop tinkering with restrictions and make the scheme a straightforward subsidy to all farmers in need of fodder.</p>
<p>“While it welcome that fodder is now coming into the country, easing the supply issue, some farmers have already spent huge amounts on fodder and will not have sufficient resources to purchase the imported fodder.”</p>
<p>Joe Healy reiterated his call on the Minister to suspend all on-farm inspections while the crisis is ongoing and to fast-track outstanding payments and remove any impediments either nationally or at EU level.</p>
<p>Farmers are awaiting the final instalment of payments under GLAS and the Sheep Welfare Scheme worth €30m. The Minister should pay out this funding immediately, as well as payments under any other scheme owed to farmers.</p>
<p>Releasing this funding would provide a badly-needed cash injection on farms at this difficult time, Joe Healy said.</p>
<p>Tillage farmers are under severe pressure to adhere to the three-crop rule under Greening requirements as very little sowing has been possible and time is running out to sow some crops, such as oats, beans and spring wheat. Joe Healy said the Minister must secure a derogation on the three-crop rule to ease the pressure on these farmers and IFA has been in direct contact with the EU Commission on this issue.</p>
<p>Joe Healy recognised the support co-ops have put in place for their supplier members but called on them to extend this to all farmer customers. He also stressed to co-ops and processors the importance of supporting farmers through this difficult period and emphasised to them that any cut in product prices would have a huge impact on farm incomes and farmer morale.</p>

<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said cattle prices are moving in the right direction and feeders are expecting strong price increases over the coming weeks as supplies tighten and UK prices continue to increase.<span id=""more-9182""></span></p>
<p>This week, he said steers are making a base of €4.00/kg and €4.05/kg is being paid to get numbers. Heifers are on a base of €4.10/kg with €4.15/kg paid in places.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said a number of factory procurement managers have indicated that they expect finished cattle supplies to tighten considerably in the coming weeks. He said, “Procurement managers and agents are saying that, based on their usual supply lines, they don’t know where they are going to get finished cattle in 10 days to 2 weeks’ time and they expect prices will rise significantly.”</p>
<p>The IFA livestock leader pointed out that cattle prices in our main export market in the UK have turned the corner and are rising. He said the AHBD have reported that for week ended March 24th prices have recorded their fourth consecutive week of rises, and are now 14p/kg above last year’s levels with processors actively looking for supplies to come forward.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said cattle prices in the UK are now the equivalent of €4.43/kg including VAT for an R3 grade steer. He said UK prices have increased to £3.88/kg over recent weeks. “With cattle prices in our main export market in the UK equivalent to €4.43/kg, there is significant potential for factories to increase prices to feeders. Across the main EU Continental market cattle prices also remain strong, with R3 young bulls in Germany making the equivalent of €4.27/kg including VAT and €4.13/kg in Italy and Spain.”</p>
<p><strong>Live exports going well</strong></p>
<p>The IFA National Livestock Chairman said live cattle exports are going well so far this year with numbers up 8% to 67,951 head to week ending March 25th. He said this is the really busy time of year for calf exports and to date this year a total of 56,165 calves have been exported with the main market destinations being the Netherlands and Spain.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said weekly calf exports are exceeding 10,000 head per week and this is necessary during these key weeks, to move numbers in line with last year’s levels. With the increase in dairy cow numbers, Ireland needs to be targeting well in excess of 100,000 head of calf exports. He said the ferry arrangements are back to normal and he added Minister Creed and the Department of Agriculture and Stena had worked well over the last number of weeks in accommodating the trade during a very busy period.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said third country live exports have also got off to a positive start this year with 4,492 cattle exported. He said two boat loads have been shipped to Turkey and another shipment has gone to Libya. In addition, Angus woods said exporters are currently buying heavier bulls for a shipment in April.</p>
<p>The IFA livestock leader said with the proper support and encouragement, the Turkish market, which has an overall live import requirement of over 500,000 head, has the potential to take up to 100,000 head of live animals from Ireland. He said, “IFA and Bord Bia visited this market and there is no doubt there is major potential for Irish live exports. Turkish feeders we met were very complementary of the quality of stock from Ireland.”</p>

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/delays-with-bdgp-tags-unacceptable/,Delays with BDGP Tags Unacceptable,29 March 2018,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>The ongoing delays in issuing genotyping tags for the BDGP scheme by the Department of Agriculture and ICBF are unacceptable and causing problems for suckler farmers, IFA Livestock Chairman Angus Woods has said.<span id=""more-9157""></span></p>
<p>He said excuses are not acceptable and the delays are impeding the efficient operation of the scheme at farm level, “The delay in issuing tags is creating problems for many suckler farmers with fragmented holdings wishing to run their operations in an efficient manner. Not having the tags on time, before the animals go to grass, is creating an extra and avoidable workload on farmers. In addition, farmers wishing to sell stock expected to have the tags on farm at this stage.”</p>
<p>Angus Woods said this is the third year of the BDGP scheme and it is high time that the Department of Agriculture and ICBF resolved the issue of late tags to farmers. He said there is no good reason why tags cannot be issued early to facilitate farmers.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the IFA livestock leader said the Department of Agriculture is working closely with individual farmers in the scheme to ensure that they will meet the October 2018 target. He said this is a very helpful approach from the Department and he encouraged farmers to take up any offers of help and assistance from the Department.</p>
