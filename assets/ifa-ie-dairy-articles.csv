<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said the voting through of key amendments on animal transport in the European Parliament today goes some way towards safeguarding competition in the cattle trade.</p>
<p>Speaking from Strasbourg, Tim Cullinan said the debate showed there is more to be done to convince legislators that we are meeting the highest standards.</p>
<p>The IFA President acknowledged the work done by Irish MEPs to get backing in the European Parliament for the amendments.</p>
<p>“From the position of Irish farming, it was vital that the key amendments were carried, but our campaign will continue.  IFA will be working with others through COPA and our MEPs to build support for animal transport, given its critical role for Ireland as an island nation,” he said.</p>
<p>“Our calves are highly sought after in the European market.  They are very robust and healthy, and thrive well. Our animal welfare and transport are of the highest standard, which is why there is such demand for our calves,” he said.</p>
<p>IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden, who is also in Strasbourg, said the recommendations from the ANIT Committee in the European Parliament for live animal transport had the potential to severely impact the competitive trade in this country, including the movements of in-calf animals, which is a key trade for farmers and marts.</p>
<p>“Irish farmers support and implement the highest welfare standards in the world and this includes the strictly controlled transport of animals.  Seeking to change the rules because other countries fail to implement them was not acceptable,” he said.</p>

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said the figures released by Bord Bia this morning for Irish food exports in 2021 show the importance of the sector to the Irish economy.</p>
<p>“Despite all the challenges, our exports grew by 4% to a record €13.5bn. This demonstrates the standing and reputation of our food, based on the raw materials produced by Irish farmers,” he said.</p>
<p>“With a massive increase in input costs – feed, energy and fertiliser – it’s critical that the price received by farmers increases across all sectors to help offset the extraordinary hike in the costs of production. It’s vital that the additional value generated by our food exports is delivered, in full, back to the farmer producing the raw material,” he said.</p>
<p>“Agriculture is our most important indigenous sector. It must be fostered and supported. Our economy is very dependent of foreign direct investment, but we must balance this with an increased focus on our indigenous sectors,” he said.</p>
<p>“We all acknowledge the need to continue to build on our environmental credentials, but we cannot do this at the expense of the economic sustainability of our primary producers,” he said.</p>
<p>“The current policy direction from the Irish Government is not striking the right balance between environmental, economic and social sustainability as set out in <em>Food Vision 2030</em>,” he said.</p>
<p>“The world will need more food and we are fortunate to have the climate and the expertise, built up on Irish farms over generations, to produce top quality food. We should be proud of this and work to support it, not undermine it,” he said.</p>

<p>The Ornua PPI for December has climbed to 135.5, an equivalent farm gate price of 41.6cpl (VAT incl). When adjusted to include the Ornua Value Payment, worth €3.72m, the equivalent farm gate price is 45.6cpl.</p>
<p>Due to rising input costs, adverse weather and more restrictive environmental policies, global milk supply from the main exporting countries has been constrained despite a substantial increase in dairy commodity prices.</p>
<p>IFA Dairy Chairman Stephen Arthur said this tightened supply is supporting the sustained rise in milk price we have seen for the past six months.</p>
<p>This week’s New Zealand GDT auctions also reported milk price increases in butter, SMP and Cheddar Cheese.</p>
<p>However, the benefits to farmers of the increase in milk price have been significantly offset by the rise in input costs.</p>
<p>Teagasc estimate that the average cost of production will increase by 13% in 2022, on top of a 9% increase in 2021. Combined, this will lead to a cost increase of circa 23% within two years and is expected to result in a decline in average incomes for dairy farmers this year.  </p>
<p>Stephen Arthur said processors must pay a milk price well in excess of 40 cent per litre this month. </p>
<p>“Given the buoyant year processors have had and the rising costs farmers will have to incur this year, every board member has to seriously consider a 13<sup>th</sup> payment for its suppliers,” he concluded.</p>

<p>IFA Dairy Chairman Stephen Arthur has said the recommendation to end the transport of unweaned calves would be devastating for the Irish dairy sector.</p>
<p>By a margin of one vote, the European Parliament’s Committee on Inquiry on the Protection of Animals During Transport (ANIT) Committee will bring forward recommendations to end the transport of unweaned calves to a plenary session of the European Parliament in January.</p>
<p>Under this recommendation, all calves would have to be more than five weeks of age prior to transport.</p>
<p>Stephen Arthur said the recommendation poses a significant threat to the trade of calves from Ireland to Europe.</p>
<p>“Our calves are highly sought after in the European market as they are more robust and healthier than calves from other European countries. Calf welfare remains of the utmost importance. However, these proposals are excessive and unnecessary given the very strong credentials of Irish calf exports,” he said.</p>
<p>In October, IFA visited the Netherlands and the feedback received was very positive on the health of exported Irish calves.</p>
<p>Intra-community trade is the cornerstone upon which the EU has been built on. Recommendations that disrupt the transport of animals and disrupt journey times leaves Ireland at a competitive disadvantage merely because of its geographical location in Europe.</p>
<p>“We cannot be treated unfairly.  Compliance with enhanced regulations to improve conditions during transport would be a more practical solution than an outright ban,” he said.</p>

<p>The Ornua PPI (Purchasing Price Index) for September is 121.8 or 36.6cpl inclusive of VAT. When adjusted to include the Ornua Value Payment, this equates to 39.86cpl.</p>
<p>IFA Dairy Chairman Stephen Arthur insists that milk processors must pay a milk price that reflects the PPI <strong>and</strong> the Ornua Value Payment.</p>
<p>In July, 2020 Ornua changed the way in which it reported the PPI. The PPI, it stated, is a measure of Ornua’s market performance on commodity products. Therefore, it should only include base commodities. Any market premium along with the members’ bonus would be expressed separately as the Ornua Value Payment.  In addition to these changes, processing costs were revised upwards from 6.5 cpl to 7.0 cpl.</p>
<p>This revised payment structure is now in place for over a year. Compared to July (€3.2m), August (€3.4m) and September (€5.8m) of 2020, the value of the Ornua value payment has tripled for July (€10.05m) and August (€10.11m) and almost doubled for September (€9.66m) of this year.</p>
<p>“Milk processors continue to pay a price which is only reflective of the PPI <strong>without </strong>the Ornua Value payment. Farmers are asking what are processors doing with this bonus and why aren’t they paying it back to them,” he said.</p>
<p>On the global market, spot commodity prices across Europe have risen in the past week and averaged €4,277 for butter (+0.9%), €2,707 (*1.3%) for SMP and €983 (+1.3%) for whey.</p>
<p>The EU futures market is also rallying for the October 2021 to May 2022 period, with price increases in the past week of €4,431 (+4.3%) for butter, €2,775 (+1.8%) for SMP and €966 (+1.0%) for whey.</p>
<p>“Significant gains need to be made on milk price this month.  When the market dips, processors are always quick to pull the price. Now that the market is buoyant, they must reflect the trade with a meaningful rise in milk price,” he said.</p>

On the global market, spot commodity prices across Europe have risen in the past week and averaged €4,277 for butter (+0.9%), €2,707 (*1.3%) for SMP and €983 (+1.3%) for whey.
The EU futures market is also rallying for the October 2021 to May 2022 period, with price increases in the past week of €4,431 (+4.3%) for butter, €2,775 (+1.8%) for SMP and €966 (+1.0%) for whey.
“Significant gains need to be made on milk price this month.  When the market dips, processors are always quick to pull the price. Now that the market is buoyant, they must reflect the trade with a meaningful rise in milk price,” he said.

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said An Taisce has a number of questions to answer following their decision to lodge another appeal of the planning permission for the Glanbia cheese plant.</p>
<p>Q1: Why won’t An Taisce accept decisions of the statutory planning appeals body An Bord Pleanala? Or our High Court?</p>
<p>As they point out, An Taisce is a prescribed body for certain planning matters under the Planning Acts. This means that they are required to be notified of certain planning applications. The same Planning Acts that grant them this status has Bord Pleanala as the planning appeals body.</p>
<p>Yet An Taisce won’t accept their decisions. It must be emphasised that the Judicial Review which An Taisce lost was not against Glanbia, it was against Bord Pleanala. Now they won’t accept a decision of the High Court.</p>
<p>An Taisce say they have ‘no choice’ but to bring an appeal because they want to raise ‘points of law’. This is nonsense as it goes way beyond their remit as a prescribed body. Furthermore, the judge in the High Court case says that it was clear that An Taisce’s real issue is with Government policy.</p>
<p>An Taisce has now lost their case three times, but it’s clear their strategy is designed to keep appealing until the project runs out of time. This is a reprehensible abuse of the planning system, their position as a prescribed body and the court system. It must be remembered that the people impacted here will be farmers and their families.</p>
<p>Q2: How is An Taisce funding these court actions?</p>
<p>An Taisce is funded from the state and from charitable donations. Which funds are they using to pay legal fees? Is it appropriate that state funds or money raised for charitable purposes is spent on legal fees?</p>
<p>Q3: Why did An Taisce fundamentally change its constitution in December?</p>
<p>An Taisce is not the same body as the one originally prescribed under the planning acts. In December 2020, An Taisce passed a new constitution.</p>
<p>This constitution considerably widened its remit and concentrated power in the hands of their board consisting of seven people. This reduced considerably the powers of its National Council. An Taisce must clarify why it took the decision to centralise power in the hands of a small few?</p>
<p>Q4: Who within An Taisce made the decision to appeal to the High Court and to appeal again?</p>
<p>An Taisce needs to state what decisions were made under the old constitution and what decisions were made under this new constitution? What body in An Taisce decided to make the initial appeal to the High Court and what body has decided to appeal it?</p>
<p>Q5: Why has An Taisce excluded their local groups from decisions on planning appeals? </p>
<p>Under the new constitution it appears An Taisce have removed any involvement for local An Taisce groups in decision making around local planning issues. The appear to only have reps from 11 regional groups on the Council. How many regional groups do An Taisce actually have? And why have they been excluded from having an input on planning matters in their own area?</p>
<p>Members of Kilkenny IFA met with An Taisce members recently at a local level. At the meeting, An Taisce reps said the decision to launch multiple appeals had been taken at headquarters level.</p>
<p>Q6: How many members do An Taisce have?</p>
<p>In the original constitution there was a provision that every regional group who had more than 400 members could have a second seat on their Council. That number has been reduced to 40 in the new constitution. This suggest that the membership of An Taisce has collapsed. An Taisce need to state publicly how many members they had at December 31st, 2020.</p>

A new milk price analysis completed by the IFA Dairy Committee shows significant differences between the milk price paid by 11 milk processors across the country.
The analysis is based on the revenue generated in 2019 and 2020 by a spring calving herd supplying 500,000 litres a year to their milk processor.
It does not include any trading bonuses, fixed price schemes or forward contracts.

<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote is-style-default""><p>Phantom creameries and dairies being used by Lidl and Aldi to mislead consumers</p></blockquote>
<p>The IFA President Tim Cullinan has criticised retailers Aldi and Lidl for their aggressive and misleading strategy to drag down the price paid to fresh milk producers.</p>
<p>“If it continues unchecked, there is a risk of a shortage of milk on shop shelves over the winter months,” Tim Cullinan said.</p>
<p>“The two retailers sell milk under the ‘Coolree Creamery’ and the ‘Clonbawn Irish Dairy’ brands. Yet neither creamery or dairy exist. Using these phantom local-sounding dairies and creameries is a marketing sleight-of-hand aimed at convincing consumers that they are buying local,” he said.</p>
<p>“Lidl and Aldi should put the brand of the actual dairy/creamery where they source their milk on the carton, not fictitious dairies and creameries designed to purposefully mislead consumers. There should be full transparency,” he said. </p>
<p>The expansion of Aldi and Lidl has coincided with the move away from established brands and it has led to a sharp reduction in the retail price, which has put downward pressure on the price paid to farmers. This has led to a 25% reduction in the number of specialist fresh milk producers. These farmers have to milk their cows 365 days of the year often with two calving seasons. </p>
<p>According to the National Milk Agency, the producer share of the final price has also fallen from 43% to 34% since 1995, a trend which is leading to an exodus from year-round production.</p>
<p>IFA Liquid Milk Chairman Keith O’Boyle said the National Dairy Council (NDC) logo is the only guarantee consumers have that the milk they are buying is produced and processed in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p>“Retailers which continue to drive down the price will ultimately drive more farmers out of business. Their policy of squeezing dairy processors and farmers to achieve footfall is totally unsustainable. If these farmers don’t keep milking all year round, we will have a shortage of milk over the winter months,” he said.</p>
<p>IFA’s campaign – <a href=""https://www.ifa.ie/campaigns/support-farmer-owned-branded-milk/"">https://www.ifa.ie/campaigns/support-farmer-owned-branded-milk/</a> – was launched this weekend and is aimed at securing a fair price for those farmers who have a year-round system that incurs higher costs.</p>

The expansion of Aldi and Lidl has coincided with the move away from established brands and it has led to a sharp reduction in the retail price, which has put downward pressure on the price paid to farmers. This has led to a 25% reduction in the number of specialist fresh milk producers. These farmers have to milk their cows 365 days of the year often with two calving seasons. 
According to the National Milk Agency, the producer share of the final price has also fallen from 43% to 34% since 1995, a trend which is leading to an exodus from year-round production.
IFA Liquid Milk Chairman Keith O’Boyle said the National Dairy Council (NDC) logo is the only guarantee consumers have that the milk they are buying is produced and processed in the Republic of Ireland.
“Retailers which continue to drive down the price will ultimately drive more farmers out of business. Their policy of squeezing dairy processors and farmers to achieve footfall is totally unsustainable. If these farmers don’t keep milking all year round, we will have a shortage of milk over the winter months,” he said.
IFA’s campaign – https://www.ifa.ie/campaigns/support-farmer-owned-branded-milk/ – was launched this weekend and is aimed at securing a fair price for those farmers who have a year-round system that incurs higher costs.
IFA will be looking to the new Food Ombudsman’s office to carry out a forensic investigation of the labelling and margins in the milk chain.

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said the announcement that Ireland will receive over €1bn, or 25%, from the EU Brexit fund in 2021 is clear recognition that we are most exposed to the fallout from Brexit.</p>
<p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney confirmed the funding at the AGM of the North Tipperary County Executive last night.</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said when it comes to allocating the funding, the impact on the agri-food sector will have to be central to any decisions.</p>
<p>“We will be making a strong case for funding to go directly to farmers who will take the brunt of any fallout from currency fluctuations and trade and logistical issues that will arise once the deal reached before Christmas works its way through the system,” he said.</p>
<p>“We have real concerns about how non-tariff barriers will impact on our ability to keep trade flows moving. Green Lanes have been implemented previously for food exports. These must be prioritised to allow us reach our markets,” he said.</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan also said the longer-term implication for our food exports could be the flooding of the UK market by cheap imports. “Farmers here on the island of Ireland and in the UK are steadfast in their view of standards,” he said.</p>
<p>We know the UK agenda is to offer access to their food market to Australia, New Zealand Canada, the US and the Mercosur countries of South America in exchange for trade deals with those countries. If that happens, then the value of the UK market for Irish food exports will be cut and Irish farmers will suffer huge income losses, with knock-on effects on EU markets. The level playing field provisions built into this deal by the EU must stop any race to the bottom. </p>

<p>IFA Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan said it’s important that processors increase the milk price returned to suppliers, and at the very least reflect Ornua returns.</p>
<p>“Our analysis shows a very stable European market with positive indications on the global front for increases in commodity prices, as farmers face into months when cash flow is extremely tight,” he said.</p>
<p>The first GDT of the new year has yielded significant gains in commodity prices, surpassing European quotations for butter, cheddar and SMP by €200-€400.</p>
<p>“Though no Irish dairy produce is traded through this auction, it does indicate to us the performance of dairy produced in the Southern Hemisphere. Given that milk production in New Zealand contracted in November and that Fonterra has forward sold a significant proportion of their produce, this could be an early sign of tightening supplies. This could in turn improve market prices,” he said.</p>
<p>The PPI for December remained stable, moving from 104.3 to 104.2.    When adjusted to include the Ornua Value Payment, we estimate that this gives a milk price of 32.86c/l.</p>
<p>“Almost all the major milk processors fell short of offering a milk price reflective of the PPI last month,” said.</p>

<p>Addressing the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture this afternoon, IFA President Tim Cullinan said regardless of the final outcome on Brexit, Irish agriculture and Irish farmers stand to lose out most.</p>
<p>“Whether or not a limited deal is achieved, the impact will be a deterioration of trade – what is at issue is the degree of that deterioration,” he said.</p>
<p>Despite massive efforts at market diversification, the UK is the current destination for 38% of Ireland’s overall agri-food exports. That is 44% of all our beef exports, 41% of cheese exports, almost 100% of mushroom exports, 60% of poultry exports, 33% of pigmeat exports, 20% of lamb exports, to name just the main sectors.</p>
<p>The IFA President set out IFA’s Brexit Emergency Plan, which is partly modelled on the EU’s response to the Russian ban on EU food imports in 2014, which shows the EU’s willingness to intervene in significant ways to support farmers faced with the impact of a geopolitical event in which they are powerless.</p>
<p>The value of EU food exports which Brexit will affect is eight times greater than the value of EU exports affected by the 2014 Russian embargo.  The value of Irish agri-food exports potentially affected by Brexit is 60 times greater than affected by the Russian embargo.</p>
<p><br/>Tim Cullinan said a Brexit outcome, which either reduces access for those products to the UK market or makes their continued sale onto that market uneconomic, will be disastrous for European farming and the livelihoods of farmers, particularly from Ireland.</p>
<p><br/>Referring to the ongoing difficulties in reaching an agreement, he said the exit of the UK from the EU without a deal would undoubtedly lead to significant trade disruption and a lose-lose situation for the entire agri-food chain.</p>
<p><br/>“Burdensome and unavoidable procedures, such as official controls of goods, SPS inspections, veterinary certificates and import tariffs will lead to increased delays for checks at borders and raise the costs for both sides,” he said.</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan set out six key measures that are needed to safeguard Irish and European agriculture:</p>
<ul><li>We want the EU and the UK to maintain the closest possible trading relationship, but the EU Single Market must be protected.</li><li>It is essential to maintain a level playing field with corresponding standards on food safety, animal health and welfare and the environment</li><li>We want to avoid burdensome delays such as control of goods and sanitary and phytosanitary inspections and veterinary certificates which will lead to delays at borders and increase costs for both sides.</li><li>Access to the UK market must be tariff-free and quota-free</li><li>There must be no return by the UK to a cheap food policy</li><li>European Agri sector is a priority for support from the €5bn Brexit Adjustment Reserve.</li></ul>

<p>Speaking at an online farmer meeting this morning, IFA President Tim Cullinan said that the Department of Agriculture had failed to prepare the sector for changes in agricultural practices and new measures due to be introduced on Jan 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>He said that the Department of Agriculture must commit to giving farmers more time to allow them to adapt to these changes, many of which are challenging.</p>
<p>“Farmers are willing to play their part but producing a Statutory Instrument in November and expecting people to be compliant by January is not realistic, and it’s unfair,” he said <br/><br/>The IFA President was speaking following an IFA online meeting this morning attended by 150 farmers.</p>
<p>Guest speakers were Jenny Deakin, Manager of the Catchment Science and Management Unit, EPA, Eddie Burgess Programme Manager of the Agricultural Catchments Programme and Bernard Harris, Nitrates Division, DAFM.</p>
<p>IFA Environment Chair, Paul O’Brien said that farmers at the meeting had highlighted the confusion around the exact specifications of the new measures.</p>
<p>He said, “Farmers must have sufficient time to plan and to try and understand these measures.

<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p><strong>Failure of Glanbia to increase price this month is further evidence that farmers are carrying processors</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>IFA Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan said that the analysis published by Teagasc and CIT claiming Irish dairy farmers are the most profitable in Europe is flawed in that it does not include the cost of the farmers own labour or land.</p>
<p>“This makes a mockery of the cost analysis. We all know that farmers and their families are putting more and more of their own time into their farms for the same return,” he said.</p>
<p>Farmers are operating at higher standards and higher costs (21% rise in fixed costs in the past five years (NFS, 2019)) for a milk price similar to 30 years ago. Improvements in milk fat and protein and quality have failed to return any price gains. Processors are using improvements in milk quality delivered by farmers to imply that they are paying a better price – this is not the case.</p>
<p>“There is a real danger that these figures will contribute to complacency by our processors who have been able to pay the lowest milk price in Europe because farmers are working harder and harder and getting better at what they are doing,” he said.</p>
<p>“Are our processors working harder and getting better at what they are doing? We need to add value to our milk to increase margins so that farmers don’t have to keep getting bigger just to stand still from an income perspective,” he said.</p>
<p>The timing of the report’s publication drew this into sharp focus; Glanbia yet again failed to increase their milk price yesterday.</p>
<p>“Premium grass-fed dairy produce must command a premium price.  It is time that farmers were properly compensated for their work and investment. This has to be reflected in an increased milk price for the remaining months of this year,” he said.</p>
<p>While average levels of debt of €64,868 on dairy farms are mentioned in the report, it is essential to remember that 64% of dairy farms have an average debt of €112,000 (National Farm Survey 2019).</p>
<p>“Let me be crystal clear on this – dairy farmers are under significant financial pressure and are working harder than they ever have before, this race to the bottom must stop.”</p>
<p>“The industry cannot sit back in smug satisfaction at this report as it does not give the full picture,” he said.</p>

“Are our processors working harder and getting better at what they are doing? We need to add value to our milk to increase margins so that farmers don’t have to keep getting bigger just to stand still from an income perspective,” he said.
The timing of the report’s publication drew this into sharp focus; Glanbia yet again failed to increase their milk price yesterday.
“Premium grass-fed dairy produce must command a premium price.  It is time that farmers were properly compensated for their work and investment. This has to be reflected in an increased milk price for the remaining months of this year,” he said.
While average levels of debt of €64,868 on dairy farms are mentioned in the report, it is essential to remember that 64% of dairy farms have an average debt of €112,000 (National Farm Survey 2019).
“Let me be crystal clear on this – dairy farmers are under significant financial pressure and are working harder than they ever have before, this race to the bottom must stop.”
“The industry cannot sit back in smug satisfaction at this report as it does not give the full picture,” he said.

<p>IFA Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan said that the Department of Agriculture did not make any proposal to IFA that dairy farms should be licensed by the EPA, as suggested in the media yesterday.</p>
<p><span id=""more-25371""></span></p>
<p>He said that any such proposal would be rejected by the IFA. Such a move would be over the top and disproportionate. “It would be tantamount to using a sledge hammer to break a nut,” he said.</p>
<p>“Media coverage yesterday based on quotes from an unnamed Department of Agriculture ‘source’ was a kite-flying exercise,” he said.</p>
<p>“Dairy farmers are already heavily regulated with cross compliance and the nitrates derogation. Farmers are also participating in voluntary programmes such as ASSAP and the Agricultural Catchments Programme to improve water quality in selected catchments,” he said.</p>
<p>“Irish dairy farmers have invested over €79.6m on Low Emission Slurry Spreading equipment which will yield positive results for water quality. Similarly, sales of protected urea have increased significantly this year. From Jan to June, just under 40,000 tonnes were sold, compared to 21,000 in 2019. Derogation farmers also abide by strict requirements to protect water, which have been enhanced in the past year following a voluntary mid-term review”.</p>
<p>The inevitable lag time between implementation of improved management practices and water quality response mean that water quality improvements may not show definitive results within the monitoring programme period, particularly as lag times are highly site and pollutant specific and can range from months to years to decades.</p>
<p>He said that the changes in agricultural practices and the new measures to be introduced as of the Jan 1<sup>st</sup> next must be given the time to work. It is the responsibility of the EPA to adjust expectations due to these lag times and recognise the time it will take for these improvements to be shown in water quality.</p>
<p>“Dairy farmers were constrained by quotas for over 30 years. It’s only natural that there would be a period of expansion following their removal in 2015. This has had huge benefits for farmers, their families and rural areas. Farmers must be given the chance to adapt their practices. Change is occurring at farm level,” he said.</p>

<p>Irish dairy exports are very similar to 2019-YTD. Exports to GB are back considerably, while exports to other EU countries are competitive. Butter prices have seen a fall in prices across the board (-25%). The food prep category includes powders for infant formula. These are considerably more valuable than the commodities we’re used to dealing with, and dominate our Chinese exports. The value of this market now supersedes our cheese market.</p>

<p><strong>Dairy Denominations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In mid-October, MEPs voted in plenary to accept an amendment to further protect the use of words to describe dairy.</li>
<li>Words such as cheese, milk, yoghurt and ice-cream are already protected and can only be used for products exclusively containing dairy.</li>
<li>This amendment enhances this protection by also preventing descriptions such as “butter substitute” and “yoghurt-style” to be used on plant alternatives.</li>
<li>This amendment will now go to trialogue to be passed into European Common law.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TB testing – Level 5</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In light of the enhanced COVID-19 restrictions, calves can now be moved off farm without a TB test up to 120 days of age.</li>
<li>A grace period of 28 days will apply from the due date of the annual round test before the herd will be restricted. This will enable farmers with concerns about COVID-19 to delay their round test and continue trading.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BREXIT – Dairy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>IFA representatives met with Minister Simon Coveney in early October to discuss ongoing Brexit negotiations.</li>
<li>Country of Origin rules could pose as a challenge for milk collected in the North but processed in the South.</li>
<li>Though it will meet all EU standards as per the Northern Ireland Protocol, it is not recognised as ROI product.</li>
<li>While this arrangement will suffice for export to other EU MS, such product will not be eligible for export to third countries without amending existing trade agreements (of which there are 60).</li>
<li>Amending such agreements will be laborious and may come with additional asks from third countries.</li>
<li>The Minister gave assurances that he is highlighting the issue and working with affected companies to make alternative arrangements.</li>

Irish dairy exports are very similar to 2019-YTD. Exports to GB are back considerably, while exports to other EU countries are competitive. Butter prices have seen a fall in prices across the board (-25%). The food prep category includes powders for infant formula. These are considerably more valuable than the commodities we’re used to dealing with, and dominate our Chinese exports. The value of this market now supersedes our cheese market.

Vat rate on milk sold to rise to 5.6% in Jan 2021.
Carbery announced a 3 year fixed milk price scheme of 33c/L


Budget Outcomes

€5m allocated for a calf weighing measure for farmers that rear dairy calves.
Consanguinity relief has been extended to the 31st December 2023 – effective stamp duty rate of 1% Consolidation relief has been extended until December 2022 – effective Stamp Duty rate of 1%.
Vat flat rate addition rose to 5.6%.
Earned Income credit (self-employed) increased by €150 to €1650 – in line with PAYE earners.

DAFM Inspections during Level 5

Inspections can go ahead during Level 5.
48 hour notice for all inspections.
Where the farmer has COVID 19 – a representative can be present for the inspection or the inspection can be postponed for 3 weeks.
Where the farmer is self-isolating – a representative can be present for the inspection or the inspection can be postponed for 3 weeks. Payment processing may be delayed if inspection is deferred.
Where the farmer is concerned about exposure to COVID-19 – a representative can be present for the inspection instead. In exceptional circumstances the inspection can be deferred by three weeks but no longer. Delaying the inspection may result in delayed processing of payments.

Dairy Denominations

In mid-October, MEPs voted in plenary to accept an amendment to further protect the use of words to describe dairy.
Words such as cheese, milk, yoghurt and ice-cream are already protected and can only be used for products exclusively containing dairy.
This amendment enhances this protection by also preventing descriptions such as “butter substitute” and “yoghurt-style” to be used on plant alternatives.
This amendment will now go to trialogue to be passed into European Common law.

TB testing – Level 5

In light of the enhanced COVID-19 restrictions, calves can now be moved off farm without a TB test up to 120 days of age.
A grace period of 28 days will apply from the due date of the annual round test before the herd will be restricted. This will enable farmers with concerns about COVID-19 to delay their round test and continue trading.

BREXIT – Dairy

IFA representatives met with Minister Simon Coveney in early October to discuss ongoing Brexit negotiations.
Country of Origin rules could pose as a challenge for milk collected in the North but processed in the South.
Though it will meet all EU standards as per the Northern Ireland Protocol, it is not recognised as ROI product.
While this arrangement will suffice for export to other EU MS, such product will not be eligible for export to third countries without amending existing trade agreements (of which there are 60).
Amending such agreements will be laborious and may come with additional asks from third countries.
The Minister gave assurances that he is highlighting the issue and working with affected companies to make alternative arrangements.

Climate Change – Progress

IFA issued a press release in Oct documenting farmers achievements in transitioning to the use of LESS and protected urea which was picked up by the Irish Times.
With TAMS support, farmers have already invested an estimated €79.6m in LESS equipment such as trailing shoes and dribble bars.
Sales of protected urea have increased significantly this year. From January to June, just under 40,000 tonnes were sold, compared to 21,000 in 2019.

Dates for the Diary

TAMs application deadline extended to the 13th November.
Nitrates – slurry export forms due in 31st December 2020.
Nitrates – dairy cows stocking rate to increase from 85 to 89kgN/year. Please check with your advisor if this impacts your overall farm stocking rate for nitrates.

<p><span id=""more-25290""></span></p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said IFA supports the recognition of Irish beef production through the PGI process and fully recognises the importance of having this important marketing tool for our beef.</p>
<p>“IFA supported the principle of making a PGI application at the last Taskforce meeting. However, as agreed at that meeting, issues remained to be resolved with the application. IFA has held productive talks with the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue, the Taskforce Chairman, the Department of Agriculture and Bord Bia to address these,” he said.</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said significant amendments have been made to the original application to reflect the key issues identified by IFA. These include changes to the travel times; haulage requirements; flexibilities to the 220-day requirement; and the assessment of eligibility of product.</p>
<p>However, the key issues of developing a meaningful brand for suckler beef that will be supported by the PGI application; ownership/control of these brands; and the eligibility of bulls are the outstanding issues to be resolved.</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said in developing a suckler brand, it must be under the control of farmers and must be an additional recognition above PGI status for beef produced from suckler farms. This will require dedicated funding ring-fenced in Bord Bia for the development of a brand that promotes the production systems on suckler farms recognising the societal and environmental contribution the sector makes to the country and the high-quality product that the sector produces.</p>
<p>The current €3m allocation over three years is not adequate to develop a brand of this importance to suckler farmers.  “Farmers must have control of both brands and we need to see a firm commitment from Bord Bia that funding levels will ensure the suckler brand generates real returns to suckler farmers.”</p>

<p>At a meeting with the Department of Agriculture, IFA called for an early decision to allow for the extension of key farm schemes, such as GLAS and TAMS.</p>
<p>IFA Rural Development Chairman Michael Biggins said that 36,000 farmers, who are currently in GLAS 1 and 2, need certainty that their plans will be extended into 2021 and beyond if necessary, under EU CAP Transitional rules.</p>
<p>“It is vitally important that a decision to extend GLAS plans is made soon as the last thing farmers need is uncertainty and a rush to get extensions in before the end of the year,” he said.</p>

<p>In relation to TAMS, the Department confirmed to IFA that Tranche 19 will close on Oct 31<sup>st</sup> and that Tranche 20 will close on Dec 31<sup>st</sup>.  The Department also confirmed to IFA that 4,688 farmers have applied under Tranche 18, which closed in August. 70% of those will shortly get an approval to proceed.</p>
<p>The IFA Rural Development Chairman pointed out that the carryover of applicants from one Tranche into another is totally unsatisfactory and he called on the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue to sort this out.</p>

The Department pointed out, that so far this year, they have spent €54.8m out of a total allocation of €82.5m.  IFA is encouraging farmers to make their payment claim as soon as possible.

<p>The decision by the European Commission to prolong anti-dumping measures on Ammonium Nitrate from Russia for another five years is a further blow to European agriculture as Irish farmers will continue to face high-priced nitrogen fertiliser prices in a market devoid of fair competition.</p>
<p>“It is incredible that a measure introduced in 1995 will now be extended to 2025 in order to assure and protect the profitability of European fertiliser producers while farmers face further decline in income due to higher costs. We believe that if this proposal is unchanged that the extension of the anti-dumping measure will cost European farmers up to €3bn in additional costs (AN and CAN fertiliser).” He said.</p>
<p>“The case put forward by the Commission was full of conjecture and referred to a possible threat of dumping on the European market, with product ‘likely to spill over to the Union market’ but with no concrete evidence.”</p>
<p>Anti-dumping duties are an additional cost charged to companies trying to export product into the European Union where it is decided  by the Commission that the price is below cost and dumping is taking place; on top of a customs duty of 6.5% and transport costs, Ammonium Nitrate from Russia is charged an additional €32.71/tonne and as a result this product is not competitive; does not enter the market in significant quantities; and European manufacturers have a closed and protected market to themselves.</p>
<p>The Commission indicated that it was difficult to assess the precise cost of Ammonium Nitrate for all farms and it was regrettable that due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Commission case team were not in a position to visit the farms of the French farmers who had offered to show the impact first hand of high fertiliser costs on their farms.</p>
<p>“We are paying over the odds for fertiliser in Ireland and Europe and even when natural gas costs decrease, the Commission believes a time lag of five months is acceptable before fertiliser prices show a decrease. Since June 2019, gas prices have declined by 66% but Ammonium Nitrate prices have only fallen 19%.”</p>
<p>Tim Cullinan said, “the Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski has not replied to my letter sent to him in July on this matter.  We need to see him come out and defend farmers’ livelihoods by demanding a fairer market for fertiliser inputs. This decision achieves just the opposite”.</p>

<p><strong>GDT: mostly Oceanian product trading</strong></p>
<p>Many will have been worried by the 5.1% drop in the average GDT index in the first auction in August earlier this week.  The first thing to note is that trade concerns mostly new season Oceanian product for the period from Sept to December 2020.  Very little powder and no butter from European traders featured in this event.<br/>Also, August does tend to be a summer holiday month the world over.  Serious trading decisions regarding the really heavy trading period – the last quarter of 2020 and first of 2021 – which gathers most of the demand promoting events and religious festivals (Thanks Giving, Christmas, Passover, New Year, Chinese New Year, Easter, Ramadan…) will start from autumn, after the summer holiday period.<br/>So, we should not read too much in this month’s GDT results.</p>
<p><strong>Global milk supplies subdued till May, now picking up </strong></p>
<p>US milk supplies for June were up a massive 5% compared to last year, but that followed an equally steep 5% drop for May.</p>
<p>EU supplies were up 1.3% to May, leapyear adjusted, with the EU Commission predicting an overall increase for 2020 of just 0.7%, which would suggest tighter supplies for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>New Zealand production for June – the trough month – was up 2% on June 2019.  Jan to June was up only 1%, but we are now in the new 2020/21 season.</p>
<p>Australian milk supplies for May were up a whopping 6%, following a series of monthly increases since January.  Season todate, however (July 2019 to May 2020) is down 0.6%.</p>

<p><strong>Demand continues to be sustained by COVID19 supports</strong></p>
<p>Just as the Irish government has brought in a July stimulus package, so have various governments around the world extended (or not!) the initial COVID19 supports targeted to businesses, employers and employees.  Those have played a crucial part in sustaining purchasing power and therefore demand, including for food and dairy.</p>
<p>Trade has resumed, with Chinese imports a mixed picture for June and the year to June.  Butter and AMF (butteroil) are doing quite well, while powder imports are weaker and infant formula just marks time for the year to June.</p>
<p>Whey powder and whey protein concentrates and lactose also appear to do quite well.</p>

<p>EU exports of butter and WMP have performed well, through the pandemic, with other products a less positive picture.</p>
<p>Butter exports for January to May rose a whopping 37% with WMP a more measured 8%.  SMP was down 17%, with cheese down 4%.</p>
<p><strong>Outlook for milk prices?</strong></p>
<p>In the rest of Europe, milk prices are recovering after steep falls.</p>
<p>Friesland Campina’s guaranteed prices has increased for July by €0.5/100 kgs, and by €1.00/100kgs for August.  Over those two months, that is equivalent to around 1.25c/l at Irish constituents over those two months.  The August milk price, at Irish constituents, would be equivalent to 28.5 + VAT (30.05 incl Irish VAT at 5.4%).</p>
<p>Arla UK will pay 29.26ppl for August milk, which at Irish constituent level is equivalent to 29.33c/l.</p>
<p>August milk prices for French suppliers to Sodiaal Co-op hover around 34c/l (3.2-3.8 constituents) and 36c/l (3.3-4.2 constituents) in Savencia.  Those prices include seasonality bonuses, and are an increase for Sodiaal, and same as July for Savencia.</p>
<p>Irish milk purchasing co-ops (see table right, based on the cents per litre column in the monthly Farmers’ Journal League, which is not ranked on that column, but on the value of solids in €/kg) have increased milk prices in June by an average of 0.84c/l + VAT (88.5c/l incl VAT).</p>
<p>The simple average of the table for June suggests an average price of 29.11c/l + VAT (30.68c/l incl VAT).  It is clear that this simple average is heavily influenced by the performance of the West Cork co-ops, all paying in excess of 30c/l + VAT – in fact the only milk purchasers to do so.</p>

Dairy Market Blog – Dairy prices stable to firm
Market returns, after falling steeply between February and mid-April due to the impact of COVID19 on food services and trade generally, have been rallying since May.  In recent weeks, spots have stabilised at those improved levels.  While they have a way to go to recover to pre-COVID19 levels, they nonetheless support current price levels comfortably, as is obvious from the gross returns/milk price equivalents from the main market indicators in the tables here.

GDT: mostly Oceanian product trading
Many will have been worried by the 5.1% drop in the average GDT index in the first auction in August earlier this week.  The first thing to note is that trade concerns mostly new season Oceanian product for the period from Sept to December 2020.  Very little powder and no butter from European traders featured in this event.Also, August does tend to be a summer holiday month the world over.  Serious trading decisions regarding the really heavy trading period – the last quarter of 2020 and first of 2021 – which gathers most of the demand promoting events and religious festivals (Thanks Giving, Christmas, Passover, New Year, Chinese New Year, Easter, Ramadan…) will start from autumn, after the summer holiday period.So, we should not read too much in this month’s GDT results.
Global milk supplies subdued till May, now picking up 
US milk supplies for June were up a massive 5% compared to last year, but that followed an equally steep 5% drop for May.
EU supplies were up 1.3% to May, leapyear adjusted, with the EU Commission predicting an overall increase for 2020 of just 0.7%, which would suggest tighter supplies for the remainder of the year.
New Zealand production for June – the trough month – was up 2% on June 2019.  Jan to June was up only 1%, but we are now in the new 2020/21 season.
Australian milk supplies for May were up a whopping 6%, following a series of monthly increases since January.  Season todate, however (July 2019 to May 2020) is down 0.6%.

Demand continues to be sustained by COVID19 supports
Just as the Irish government has brought in a July stimulus package, so have various governments around the world extended (or not!) the initial COVID19 supports targeted to businesses, employers and employees.  Those have played a crucial part in sustaining purchasing power and therefore demand, including for food and dairy.
Trade has resumed, with Chinese imports a mixed picture for June and the year to June.  Butter and AMF (butteroil) are doing quite well, while powder imports are weaker and infant formula just marks time for the year to June.
Whey powder and whey protein concentrates and lactose also appear to do quite well.

EU exports of butter and WMP have performed well, through the pandemic, with other products a less positive picture.
Butter exports for January to May rose a whopping 37% with WMP a more measured 8%.  SMP was down 17%, with cheese down 4%.
Outlook for milk prices?
In the rest of Europe, milk prices are recovering after steep falls.
Friesland Campina’s guaranteed prices has increased for July by €0.5/100 kgs, and by €1.00/100kgs for August.  Over those two months, that is equivalent to around 1.25c/l at Irish constituents over those two months.  The August milk price, at Irish constituents, would be equivalent to 28.5 + VAT (30.05 incl Irish VAT at 5.4%).
Arla UK will pay 29.26ppl for August milk, which at Irish constituent level is equivalent to 29.33c/l.
August milk prices for French suppliers to Sodiaal Co-op hover around 34c/l (3.2-3.8 constituents) and 36c/l (3.3-4.2 constituents) in Savencia.  Those prices include seasonality bonuses, and are an increase for Sodiaal, and same as July for Savencia.
Irish milk purchasing co-ops (see table right, based on the cents per litre column in the monthly Farmers’ Journal League, which is not ranked on that column, but on the value of solids in €/kg) have increased milk prices in June by an average of 0.84c/l + VAT (88.5c/l incl VAT).
The simple average of the table for June suggests an average price of 29.11c/l + VAT (30.68c/l incl VAT).  It is clear that this simple average is heavily influenced by the performance of the West Cork co-ops, all paying in excess of 30c/l + VAT – in fact the only milk purchasers to do so.

Commodity indicators as analysed above, would suggest that there is scope at least for the lower payers in the table above to further improve their July milk price.  Anything less than 1c/l would be mean spirited, as volumes start to dwindle past peak.

<p><strong>Ornua should continue to publish PPI in the old and new format</strong></p>
<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said that farmers are disappointed with the decision by Ornua to amend its Purchasing Price Index (PPI).</p>
<p>“In particular farmers can’t understand the increased allocation for processing costs, despite the investments made in modern processing facilities,” he said.</p>
<p>“With over 50% more milk going through more modern plants, farmers cannot understand how costs are increasing when increased throughput should reduce them,” he said.</p>
<p>IFA has consistently communicated to Ornua, at the board table and at the top-level the serious concerns of farmers who feared the review would take away from the transparency of the PPI.</p>
<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan stated, “It would also have made more sense to farmers for this decision to be considered by the new Ornua board due to come into Office later this year. The onus is now firmly on Ornua to prove to farmers that this new format will continue to serve them as well as the previous version”.</p>
<p>“IFA and farmers value the contribution to market and price transparency that the Ornua PPI has made over the years. Farmers fear that today’s changes may undermine the transparency of the index and its relevance to their milk price. Ornua must now come out and explain these changes to farmers, and prove to their satisfaction that it will continue to serve farmers well,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“In the interim, and in the interest of transparency, Ornua should continue to publish the index in the old format alongside the proposed new format,” he concluded.</p>

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said he was shocked to learn that, in the middle of a pandemic which should have taught us all the importance to keep the food chain economically sustainable, some suppliers of fresh milk to the Irish retail trade appeared to have resumed aggressive undercutting practices to secure a slightly bigger share of a static market.</p>

<p>“There is competition, and then there are unfair, unsustainable practices, where retailers pressure suppliers to offer ever lower prices.  The dairies that sell our milk need to wise up and resist those pressures – we know their inevitable results: the devaluation of a high quality, nutritious product and lower milk prices for farmers.  That is not acceptable,” Mr Cullinan said.</p>

<p>He warned the dairy industry could not ignore that low milk price levels and rising overhead costs at farm level were not a sound basis for a sustainable development of the sector.</p>

<p>“The increase of 9% reported in the NFS for 2019 actually represents a whopping 25% drop compared to 2017.  The improvement in 2019 relative to the severe drought year that was 2018 was the result of lower spend on fodder and feed, combined with higher milk volumes produced.

<p><strong>Lockdown exit and government stimuli promote dairy demand and boost prices</strong></p>
<p>The total disappearance of demand from the food services market (cafes, restaurants, institutional restaurants and school canteens) which followed the quasi global lockdown in March has hit dairy markets hard.  Dairy commodity prices plummeted: butter fell 24% between early Jan and early May while SMP fell 27% roughly over the same period.</p>
<p>Since then, the gradual reopening of economies first in Asia, then in Europe, has allowed demand to slowly recover as supply pipeline are being replenished and consumer demand for food services returns tentatively in the new, socially distanced “normal”.</p>
<p>In most of Europe, we have seen phased reopening plans speeded up as the public health statistics appeared to justify it.  Beyond Europe, especially in Asia, the reopening of food services is even further advanced, and trade is reported by some operators as improving more than heretofore, with demand from food services recovering to over 50% of normal while retail sales remain very strong.</p>
<p>While some operators warn that this is linked to the refilling of pipelines depleted by the lockdown, and may slow when those are full again, others report a very real improvement in trade.</p>

<p>This has allowed dairy product prices to recover substantially, though not yet to January 2020 equivalents.  This has also helped stabilised May milk prices in Ireland, with Dairygold actually increasing its payout by 0.5c/l.</p>

<p>Most market indicators have been showing improvements since mid-April, though they remain below January 2020 levels.  However, most would appear to have reached levels that would underpin current milk prices, and possibly a small improvement.  In the first table, the EU MMO average returns are given gross, before deduction of processing costs.</p>
<p>The first table below shows the gross (no processing cost deducted) returns from a representative Irish product mix, based on the most recent available prices reported by the EU Milk Market Observatory.</p>
<p>In the second table, showing the main national, EU and international dairy market indicator, returns have been calculated, to factor in a nominal 5c/l deducted from the returns to approximate the milk price equivalent of each indicator.</p>
<p>This is a convention rather than a precise processing cost: those are not independently published by any dairy company anywhere around the world.  What is most valuable about monitoring indices is their evolution and changes up or down, as well as the pace of their change, so trends, rather than the absolute numbers.</p>

European supplies have shown a similar dynamic, with April production up 0.8% and output over the January to April period up 1.6% leap-year adjusted according to the EU MMO, with significant differences between Member  States (see graph below).</br></p>
<p>The April/May challenge to European production linked to moisture deficit has started to correct itself during June, with rain fall increasing in the most affected areas.  However, it may be a case of too little too late for some regions, where it would have already impacted fodder production for the year.</p>
<p>Looking in more detail, the French April production reduction initiative appears to have borne fruit right till May, with output rising by only 0.6% in April, and falling into May.  For the period from 1<sup>st</sup> April to the first week of June, INTL FCStone estimate French milk output was back 1.3%.</p>
<p>UK milk supplies, which the EU no longer accounts for as part of the EU 27, were also down 1.8% for the January to April period.</p>

<p>As well as a slight moderation of some of the late spring/early summer output from some of the main dairy EU member states, we have seen some use of the EU Private Storage scheme which remains open for application till 30<sup>th</sup> June – and this will have had the effect of taking product temporarily off the market, especially butter.</p>
<p>The Cheese APS, which failed to recognise appropriately the importance of cheese to the Irish product mix, and only allocated Ireland a miserly 2180t filled within 3 days of the 7<sup>th</sup> May opening, is only 44% utilised todate – with only a few days to go to the closing date.  While the Irish government has sought an opening of all allocations to allow for more use, this does not appear to have been accepted by the EU Commission.</p>
<p>Perhaps more helpful is the butter scheme, which has taken in almost 55,000t todate, with Ireland contributing 11,709t.  Commentators suggested that maybe as much as a quarter of all butter made during the period went into APS – which would suggest optimism as to the price level to be expected when the product must come out next autumn.</p>

<p><strong>Massive US supports have also helped April to June dairy market improvements</strong></p>
<p>In a recent global dairy market webinar by INTL FCStone, one of the US analysts stated categorically that the massive levels of supports given by the US Government in a bid to offset the disastrous economic impact of COVID 19 on US farmers’ prices and incomes had played a determining role in sustaining dairy prices globally.</p>
<p>Put more clearly, he suggested that the supports provided, which saw massive government food purchases, ensured that dairy commodity prices were supported, and massive price drops were could be corrected, avoiding a generalised collapse.  The graphs for US butter and cheese prices show the impact of the purchasing supports very clearly.</p>

Lockdown exit and government stimuli promote dairy demand and boost prices
The total disappearance of demand from the food services market (cafes, restaurants, institutional restaurants and school canteens) which followed the quasi global lockdown in March has hit dairy markets hard.  Dairy commodity prices plummeted: butter fell 24% between early Jan and early May while SMP fell 27% roughly over the same period.
Since then, the gradual reopening of economies first in Asia, then in Europe, has allowed demand to slowly recover as supply pipeline are being replenished and consumer demand for food services returns tentatively in the new, socially distanced “normal”.
In most of Europe, we have seen phased reopening plans speeded up as the public health statistics appeared to justify it.  Beyond Europe, especially in Asia, the reopening of food services is even further advanced, and trade is reported by some operators as improving more than heretofore, with demand from food services recovering to over 50% of normal while retail sales remain very strong.
While some operators warn that this is linked to the refilling of pipelines depleted by the lockdown, and may slow when those are full again, others report a very real improvement in trade.

Based on data from INTL FCStone
The table below shows that EU exports have continued strong for the month of April and the Jan/April period, with the exception of SMP.  EU exports of butter, butteroil (AMF), whey and pharmaceutical grade lactose have all increased substantially over the period, despite the pandemic.
This has allowed dairy product prices to recover substantially, though not yet to January 2020 equivalents.  This has also helped stabilised May milk prices in Ireland, with Dairygold actually increasing its payout by 0.5c/l.

Source: INTL FCStone
Most market indicators have been showing improvements since mid-April, though they remain below January 2020 levels.  However, most would appear to have reached levels that would underpin current milk prices, and possibly a small improvement.  In the first table, the EU MMO average returns are given gross, before deduction of processing costs.
The first table below shows the gross (no processing cost deducted) returns from a representative Irish product mix, based on the most recent available prices reported by the EU Milk Market Observatory.
In the second table, showing the main national, EU and international dairy market indicator, returns have been calculated, to factor in a nominal 5c/l deducted from the returns to approximate the milk price equivalent of each indicator.
This is a convention rather than a precise processing cost: those are not independently published by any dairy company anywhere around the world.  What is most valuable about monitoring indices is their evolution and changes up or down, as well as the pace of their change, so trends, rather than the absolute numbers.
The second table below shows that some returns have recovered up to half the fall that occurred between January and mid-April, and most appear to be still on an upward trend – which should augur well for at least the stability, or even improvement, of milk prices in the short to medium term at least.

Based on EU MMO data

Milk production rising to April, but…
With a lower than expected fall in milk prices and significant supports in the US, production has been rising more strongly into April in all regions except New Zealand.
Global April milk production is estimated to have increased 1.3% when compared to the same month last year.
For the January to April period, it is believed to have increased by 2.3%, which suggests a slowing trend.

Source: Bord Bia
European supplies have shown a similar dynamic, with April production up 0.8% and output over the January to April period up 1.6% leap-year adjusted according to the EU MMO, with significant differences between Member  States (see graph below).
The April/May challenge to European production linked to moisture deficit has started to correct itself during June, with rain fall increasing in the most affected areas.  However, it may be a case of too little too late for some regions, where it would have already impacted fodder production for the year.
Looking in more detail, the French April production reduction initiative appears to have borne fruit right till May, with output rising by only 0.6% in April, and falling into May.  For the period from 1st April to the first week of June, INTL FCStone estimate French milk output was back 1.3%.
UK milk supplies, which the EU no longer accounts for as part of the EU 27, were also down 1.8% for the January to April period.

<p>Speaking to Irish consumers and retailers today on World Milk Day, IFA National Liquid Milk Chairman John Finn urged them, in these unprecedented times of pandemic, to especially value the locally produced fresh milk which they expect to find every day on their supermarket shelves, and to make sure the farmers are paid a fair price for their hard work.</p>
<p><span id=""more-21590""></span></p>
<p>“It is worth remembering that our essential workers – 1,800 specialised farmers, milk collection truck drivers and processing plant staff – play a vital role in making sure that we can find a carton or a bottle of locally produced, high quality fresh milk for our tea and our cereals in every shop, every day of the year, even during lockdown,” he added.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Farmer who produce this fresh milk have worked tirelessly this spring to calve cows and plan next autumn and spring’s breeding seasons, and are now harvesting silage for winter fodder.  Their necessary specialisation for year-round production means that their costs are higher than spring milk producers, whose milk is mostly destined for processing into exportable commodities.  It is essential that their hard work is recognised and better wholesale prices paid as retailers negotiate with dairies over the coming weeks,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Retail grocery sales increased by over 17% between late February and late April 2020 according to Kantar Worldpanel.  This trend also benefited sales of liquid milk, including buttermilk and cream as baking and cooking at home increased during lockdown,” he added.</p>

<p>“Retailers and consumers must not take fresh milk for granted.  Farmers must be paid a fair share of the improved returns retailers have enjoyed because of increased retail sales,” he concluded.</p>

<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan called on co-ops to reflect on the significant dairy product price improvements of the last six weeks, which allow them to maximise the May milk price to support farmers’ stressed cash flow.</p>
<p><span id=""more-21598""></span></p>
<p>He said the Ornua PPI increase of 1.3 points to an equivalent of 29.9c/l including VAT is the latest evidence to suggest co-ops must maximise their May milk price.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“2020 is a difficult year for farmers.  Co-ops must review their expectations for profit, and focus on digging deeper into their own cost structures to support their suppliers.

<p> </p>
<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan added: “Early signs of drought in Northern Europe, and a poor start to the new season in New Zealand as well as a gradual reopening of the global economy and food services trade have contributed to a more positive market sentiment.  In the last six weeks, we have seen spot prices increase by €532/t for butter, and €230/t for SMP.  They breached €3,000/t and €2,000/t respectively two weeks ago.  It is well known that spots are indicative of market trends, and therefore predict further improvements in average prices”.</p>

<p><strong>Light at the end of the tunnel?</strong></p>
<p><strong>More milk, challenges on demand – but improved mid-term outlook?</strong></p>
<p>After up to 2c/l in March, most co-ops have by now announced a 1c/l cut on April milk.  This is quite a blow coming up to peak.  Assuming no further adjustment, and over the peak months of March to June inclusive alone, that is up to a €6500 loss for an average dairy farmer producing 500,000l.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that market returns have been affected by the impact of COVID19 on global demand.  Food services closing practically overnight the world over has resulted in milk in search of an outlet going to create surpluses in other areas, and putting pressure on commodity prices.</p>
<p>In addition, milk supplies have been increasing this spring in most regions except New Zealand in the first quarter of 2020 – total additional output for the period is estimated by INTL FCStone at 2.6%, and by Ornua at a more conservative 1.4% for the top five production/exporting regions compared to the same period in 2019.  The difference in expectation for March are narrower, with FCStone indicating 1.58% and Ornua 1.4%.</p>
<p>The significant increase in US production for the period is particularly remarkable, bearing in mind the crash in milk prices, and the fact that farmers in some states have had to dispose of milk.  The Australian increase follows months, if not years of decreases.  More important are the significant increases in EU milk production, nearly 2.5% for the first quarter, though more modest at 1.12% for March.  Many take the view that significant milk price falls almost the world over in the first half of the year will contribute to more modest output growth in the second half.</p>

<p>It is worth noting however that the two largest producers, namely France and Germany have experienced only modest growth in March.   This modest trend has continued into April in both countries – see table right, which in the last three lines captures the first 3 weeks of April (15 to 17) for France on the left and Germany on the right.<br>
French industry organisation CNIEL has expressed a view that production has been moderated in April, a month for which they received retrospective approval for the incentivisation to the tune of up to 32c/l of a 2 to 5% reduction in April 2020 production relative to April 2019.</br></p>

<p>Demand meanwhile has been very severely impacted by the collapse in food services.  In the EU and the US, retail sales have increased spectacularly as consumers eat all their meals at home – up 17% in Ireland for all groceries in the last 2 months according to Kantar WorldPanel –  but not so much as to offset the difference.  Product unused in food services cannot always be shifted directly into retail – e.g. catering size packs of semi-processed creams for cooking and pastry.  However milk not processed into those products has found its way into other processing chains – say butter in the case of cream – where it creates product surpluses which put pressure on product prices.</p>
<p><strong>Have dairy prices bottomed out?</strong></p>
<p>Dairy futures and spots have been firming for the last 3 to 4 weeks, with average current market prices reported by the EU MMO a little slower to follow.<br>
As demonstrated by the graph right, between the 8<sup>th</sup> April and 13<sup>th</sup> May, the average spots quoted for SMP in Germany, France and the Netherlands increased by €80/t or 4.2%,  for butter by €160/t or 6.2% and for whey powder by €71/t or 11.2%.<br>
There is increasing evidence that dairy prices may have bottomed out – unfortunately at a very low level, but still well above intervention equivalent.</br></br></p>

<p><strong>Dairy returns down on January, but some firming</strong></p>
<p>Returns are still quite a bit below where they were in early January, as is clear from the table right, and remain for most of them just a little below our estimate of Irish milk prices for April 2020.<br>
However, there have been some (small) improvement in spots in particular.</br></p>

<p><strong>APS supports</strong></p>
<p>A very limited APS scheme was reluctantly introduced by the EU Commission, with a budget of €30m for all of the EU’s dairy sector out of a total APS scheme of €76m.  While it is clearly insufficient, the very fact that the EU has shown it would support the sector after giving very negative responses, has contributed to the bottoming out of prices, and in particular has helped remove the threat of SMP prices collapsing in short order to intervention level.<br>
As we write (20<sup>th</sup> May), around 34% of the EU cheese for all countries (100,000t) has been utilised.  Ireland had utilised its own very modest 2180t in the first few days of operation as had Italy, Sweden and the UK.  They are now joined, by Spain, with the Netherland and Belgium have by now utilised ¾ of their own allocation.</br></p>
<p>Ireland has sought a reallocation of all unused quantities to boost its own very modest tonnage – but that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>A few countries have also put SMP into storage, with both more countries and more volumes of butter being stored in both the first and second weeks, as outlined in the table on the right.</p>

<p>However more than APS supports which are extremely modest, other positive market signals have been crucial to helping dairy prices first bottom out, and now hopefully firm up – at least for powders.</p>
<p>Firstly, there is the real prospect of food services coming back on line – very slowly – as countries world-wide progressively come out of lockdown and re-open their economies and societies.  In Europe, most countries have either already reopened their restaurant/café trade, or will do so before the end of June.  The table below is a roundup of the planned or already implemented measures by the main European countries with regards to reopening at least certain aspects of the hospitality trade.</p>

<p>Further afield in China and the rest of Asia, where the progress out of lockdown is more advanced, food trade has increased substantially.  For some markets, the pipelines are empty after the lockdown, and demand to to refill those is very significant.</p>
<p>Food imports are being prioritised into China, for example, and the figures for imports (right) show strong results for March, benefiting the EU (and the US) in particular.</p>

<p><strong>What prospect for farmgate milk prices this summer?</strong></p>
<p>After the major shock of up to 3c/l coming off the first two big months of the dairy year, and somewhat more optimistic prospects for dairy markets than was feared even only a few weeks ago, farmers could legitimately expect stable milk prices over the next few months.</p>
<p>Most co-ops, we have shown in throughout 2019 and into 2020, have undershot the most relevant indicators (including the Ornua PPI) for most of the last 18 months, and would therefore have some scope to hold prices while markets come back to meet them.</p>
<p>There remains some uncertainty, of course:  Firstly, we do not know how long it will take for our food services customers to return to sufficient levels of normality after the COVID19 lockdown to constitute again a strong outlet for dairy products.</p>
<p>Secondly, we do not know the extent to which the impact of the lockdown on the economy will affect consumer purchasing power and demand.</p>
<p>And finally, the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit appears to have increased in recent weeks, as the UK refuses to seek an extension of the transition period which ends, reneges on its customs commitments between the EU and the UK with regards to the NI/UK/ROI situation, and as British MPs last week voted against a bill aiming to protect UK farmers in terms of food standards conceded on imports.</p>
<p>2020 will be a difficult year for farmers.  Farmers will need support, from the EU and government in terms of market support measures and the provision of COVID19 related competitively priced working capital, and also from the perspective of achieving the best possible deal on Brexit, and should no deal be doable, to be supported in coping with the impact on markets and prices.</p>
<p>But they will also need support from their co-ops.  The fact is that with COVID19 has created a huge challenge on the sector, which boards, management teams and most of all workers in co-ops have managed remarkably, by collaborating on complex re-organising and contingency plans which farmers are fully appreciative of.  As a result, every drop of milk through peak is being collected and processed, which is crucially important for farmers.</p>
<p>Beyond this, however, co-ops must do everything in their power to hold prices at the highest possible level.  The medium-term outlook is better than, or at least not as bad as, was earlier predicted.  Farmers will need their co-ops to look to costs beyond milk prices, and just like farmers are having to do, reconsider their margin expectations for the year.</p>
</div>","
Light at the end of the tunnel?
More milk, challenges on demand – but improved mid-term outlook?
After up to 2c/l in March, most co-ops have by now announced a 1c/l cut on April milk.  This is quite a blow coming up to peak.  Assuming no further adjustment, and over the peak months of March to June inclusive alone, that is up to a €6500 loss for an average dairy farmer producing 500,000l.
There is little doubt that market returns have been affected by the impact of COVID19 on global demand.  Food services closing practically overnight the world over has resulted in milk in search of an outlet going to create surpluses in other areas, and putting pressure on commodity prices.
In addition, milk supplies have been increasing this spring in most regions except New Zealand in the first quarter of 2020 – total additional output for the period is estimated by INTL FCStone at 2.6%, and by Ornua at a more conservative 1.4% for the top five production/exporting regions compared to the same period in 2019.  The difference in expectation for March are narrower, with FCStone indicating 1.58% and Ornua 1.4%.
The significant increase in US production for the period is particularly remarkable, bearing in mind the crash in milk prices, and the fact that farmers in some states have had to dispose of milk.  The Australian increase follows months, if not years of decreases.  More important are the significant increases in EU milk production, nearly 2.5% for the first quarter, though more modest at 1.12% for March.  Many take the view that significant milk price falls almost the world over in the first half of the year will contribute to more modest output growth in the second half.

In the EU too, all countries have seen output increases, with few exceptions, namely the UK and to a lesser degree, Denmark for the month of March.

It is worth noting however that the two largest producers, namely France and Germany have experienced only modest growth in March.   This modest trend has continued into April in both countries – see table right, which in the last three lines captures the first 3 weeks of April (15 to 17) for France on the left and Germany on the right.
French industry organisation CNIEL has expressed a view that production has been moderated in April, a month for which they received retrospective approval for the incentivisation to the tune of up to 32c/l of a 2 to 5% reduction in April 2020 production relative to April 2019.

Demand meanwhile has been very severely impacted by the collapse in food services.  In the EU and the US, retail sales have increased spectacularly as consumers eat all their meals at home – up 17% in Ireland for all groceries in the last 2 months according to Kantar WorldPanel –  but not so much as to offset the difference.  Product unused in food services cannot always be shifted directly into retail – e.g. catering size packs of semi-processed creams for cooking and pastry.  However milk not processed into those products has found its way into other processing chains – say butter in the case of cream – where it creates product surpluses which put pressure on product prices.
Have dairy prices bottomed out?
Dairy futures and spots have been firming for the last 3 to 4 weeks, with average current market prices reported by the EU MMO a little slower to follow.
As demonstrated by the graph right, between the 8th April and 13th May, the average spots quoted for SMP in Germany, France and the Netherlands increased by €80/t or 4.2%,  for butter by €160/t or 6.2% and for whey powder by €71/t or 11.2%.
There is increasing evidence that dairy prices may have bottomed out – unfortunately at a very low level, but still well above intervention equivalent.

Dairy returns down on January, but some firming
Returns are still quite a bit below where they were in early January, as is clear from the table right, and remain for most of them just a little below our estimate of Irish milk prices for April 2020.
However, there have been some (small) improvement in spots in particular.

APS supports
A very limited APS scheme was reluctantly introduced by the EU Commission, with a budget of €30m for all of the EU’s dairy sector out of a total APS scheme of €76m.  While it is clearly insufficient, the very fact that the EU has shown it would support the sector after giving very negative responses, has contributed to the bottoming out of prices, and in particular has helped remove the threat of SMP prices collapsing in short order to intervention level.
As we write (20th May), around 34% of the EU cheese for all countries (100,000t) has been utilised.  Ireland had utilised its own very modest 2180t in the first few days of operation as had Italy, Sweden and the UK.  They are now joined, by Spain, with the Netherland and Belgium have by now utilised ¾ of their own allocation.
Ireland has sought a reallocation of all unused quantities to boost its own very modest tonnage – but that remains to be seen.
A few countries have also put SMP into storage, with both more countries and more volumes of butter being stored in both the first and second weeks, as outlined in the table on the right.

However more than APS supports which are extremely modest, other positive market signals have been crucial to helping dairy prices first bottom out, and now hopefully firm up – at least for powders.
Firstly, there is the real prospect of food services coming back on line – very slowly – as countries world-wide progressively come out of lockdown and re-open their economies and societies.  In Europe, most countries have either already reopened their restaurant/café trade, or will do so before the end of June.  The table below is a roundup of the planned or already implemented measures by the main European countries with regards to reopening at least certain aspects of the hospitality trade.

<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan said the 1c/l April milk price cut announced early this week by both Glanbia and Lakeland was a further blow to dairy farmers on top a 2c/l and 1.8c/l cut respectively applied last month.</p>

<p>“It means the price to farmers is down by approximately 3c/l since March which will have a huge impact on the farmer’s margin,” he said.</p>
<p>He urged other co-ops to focus their attention on taking other costs out of their businesses.</p>
<p>“These cuts will have a big impact because they are cumulative and they are applying as we reach the peak production period. For a 500,000l milk supplier, assuming no further adjustment, those cuts will take up to €6,500 off their March to June milk sales.”</p>

IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan said the Committee was currently preparing to engage with co-op board members ahead of the early May co-ops’ meetings to set the April milk price.

He urged co-ops to optimise the April milk price after the severe March cuts, to ensure that farmers are not being asked to take all the pain of challenged dairy markets.
 
He pointed out that, as the EU has announced an admittedly limited and insufficient APS scheme for butter, SMP and cheese, spot prices for SMP and butter have stabilised in the last two weeks.
 
“While dairy markets are being seriously challenged by COVID19 and the loss of demand from food services, it is clear that the doomsday predictions of some who said dairy prices would fall to intervention levels are not materialising,” Mr Phelan said.
 
“Furthermore, dairy markets cannot be the only consideration in deciding on milk prices: with crude oil prices down 75% since early January, fuel and energy costs have plummeted for processors.  Co-ops have scope to cut costs beyond milk prices and cannot expect farmers to take all the pain,” he said.

<p>Speaking after a meeting of the National Dairy Management Committee of IFA, President Tim Cullinan said all co-ops need to re-evaluate their profit margins and expectations, just as their farmer suppliers are having to do, in response to the very real challenges caused for dairy markets by COVID19.</p>
<p><span id=""more-21456""></span></p>
<p>“Co-ops rushed to slash the March milk price, even though up to 30% of spring milk would have been sold forward at much higher than current prices.  It was clear that dairy farmers would not accept further cuts while co-ops had major scope to reduce their costs,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oil and gas prices have plummeted to historical lows, which will reduce the cost of milk assembly and processing for all co-ops.  Also, in light of the exceptional circumstances, banks have engaged with all their customers, households and businesses alike. Co-ops must use this opportunity to also seek greater leeway on their commitments,” Mr Cullinan said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan added: “Co-ops all have different ways in which they decide the price paid to suppliers, and farmers will not be distracted by the details.  All co-ops must look deep into their cost structures to hold milk prices for April”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Some co-ops, which have lagged behind on milk prices all through 2019 and into 2020, while others have consistently delivered the top prices, have more work to do to deliver for their suppliers,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We are starting to see some green shoots on markets: most of Asia is out of lockdown and dairy imports are starting to flow again, with a 20% increase in EU exports to China for March alone.  The introduction of the EU Private Storage scheme, as limited as it is, has helped improve market confidence and stabilise spot dairy commodity prices.  Many European countries are coming out of lockdown and restarting food services in coming weeks and months, progressively restoring the outlet which was cut off abruptly some weeks ago,” he added.</p>

<p>Commenting on the 1.8 to 2c/l price cuts implemented by Lakeland, Glanbia and Kerry for March milk, IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan said COVID19 has impacted on every aspect of the global economy.  “The dairy sector is no exception, and faces severe economic challenges.  However, we believe dairy farmers are being asked to pay too much of the price, too soon.”</p>
<p><span id=""more-20604""></span></p>
<p>The National Dairy Committee has in recent weeks lobbied board members to maintain March milk prices.  This campaign has been based on sound market research which showed that pre-COVID 19, the outlook for dairy markets was extremely positive.  Spots quotes then suggested a milk price equivalent of around 34c/l, and co-ops would have sold forward at least some of the spring milk into that market as normal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Also, the Ornua PPI had been improving since September, and running above the average co-op payout by over 1c/l since October.  Even despite the 2c/l cut in the Ornua PPI for March, at 31.8c/l incl VAT, it is still up to 2.4c/l above the March milk price announced by some milk processors,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“March has been a long and challenging month from a weather and cost perspective.  Maintaining the milk price would have helped farmers pay bills and better position themselves for the difficult months ahead. IFA is now calling on those processors who have yet to decide on their March milk price to think harder on what their decision will mean for their suppliers.  Cutting the milk price now to minimise what may be down the line is of no benefit to farmers today,” he stressed.</p>

<p>“IFA is lobbying, together with fellow European farm organisations and the Irish and European dairy industry, for the prompt introduction of a private storage scheme (APS) for SMP, butter and cheese.  This would help support markets for the medium term while avoiding the price depressing and accumulation effect of intervention, and allow for the release of the product later this year into an improved dairy outlook.  Co-ops need to focus their attention on maximising the milk price, and plotting a sustainable way through the crisis for their suppliers,” he concluded.</p>

<p><strong>Coronavirus affects markets in positive or negative ways – depending on whether you sell retail consumer product or not</strong></p>
<p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, dairy markets were headed for a positive 2020: modest milk supply growth, solid demand.</p>
<p>Things have changed, but not all for the bad.  We have seen a dual market impact to the outbreak of COVID-19: on the one hand, panic buying and a return to cooking at home have boosted retail sales in a significant way.  Though it must be said that even the initial stock piling has eased, and may militate against further purchases as the home stocks are consumed first.<br>
On the other hand, the closure of restaurants and cafes has meant food service sales have crashed.  I remember a statement by Starbucks some years ago that they had just reached the point where they sold more milk than coffee, globally. Losing the coffee shop sector alone is a major blow to the sector.</br></p>
<p>The graphic below illustrates well the importance of the food services market to the dairy sector.</p>
<p>A study by AHDB Dairy UK in 2018, came to the conclusion that 51% of all meals eaten out in the UK included dairy, in either of the formats below, from dairy host meals (e.g. pizza or other take away), dairy as a (hidden) ingredients, hot beverages with milk, pure dairy as in ice cream or cold dairy drinks.<a href=""https://i0.wp.com/www.ifa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/food-services.png?ssl=1""><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-82447 lazy"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" data-sizes=""(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px"" data-src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/food-services.png"" data-srcset=""https://www.ifa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/food-services.png 796w, https://www.ifa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/food-services.png 300w, https://www.ifa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/food-services.png 768w"" height=""275"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""796""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-82447"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" height=""275"" loading=""lazy"" sizes=""(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/food-services.png"" srcset=""https://www.ifa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/food-services.png 796w, https://www.ifa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/food-services.png 300w, https://www.ifa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/food-services.png 768w"" width=""796""/></noscript></a></p>

<p><strong>Dairy imports into China</strong></p>
<p>In its latest report, CLAL shows better than expected results for dairy imports into China, especially from the EU.  Overall while total volume was down by 1.9% for the first two months of 2020 (slap bang in the middle of the COVID19 pandemic in China), value is up 3.8%.  However, as the table shows, this is a mixed picture.  Milk, cream, butter, cheese and whey powder have seen continued significant increases, albeit mostly from relatively low volumes.</p>
<p>Powders, on the other hand, are well back: WMP down nearly 5%, SMP nearly 25% back, and fat filled powder down 34% – though the latter also from low volumes.</p>
<p>Infant formula is down by 1.6%.</p>

<p><strong>Green shoots in Asia?</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been such a catastrophic and global event, it is very difficult to predict anything.  However, there are interesting signs coming from China.  As it seems the country is slowly starting to come out from under the pandemic, towns which had been mandatorily locked down like Wuhan are being re-opened to quasi normal life.  Food imports have been prioritised by government.  Many operators report containers moving again, and therefore becoming available for trade.</p>
<p>Restaurants in Japan and Korea are reported to have reopened, which is a good sign, but business is most definitely not back to normal.</p>
<p>Chinese consumers are also starting to run out of imported infant formula.  There was a lot of stockpiling in the early days of the outbreak, and stores are now out of stock, while consumers are back demanding product.  EU suppliers supply 71% of all China’s IMF imports, with France and the Netherlands supplying the largest volumes, but Ireland not too far behind.</p>
<p>As food imports are been green-lighted by government as Chinese trade and business progressively returns to something approaching normal, this should in time benefit milk powder trade, and Irish infant formula manufacturers, with positive impacts for the Irish dairy sector.</p>
<p><strong>Lower commodity prices and weaker market returns</strong></p>
<p>We have documented in recent months just how global milk supplies had grown only modestly and stayed very much in tune with reasonably good demand.  The COVID19 crisis is causing a demand shock, but at a time when supply is moderate – which would not have been the case, say, when the Russian ban hit back in late 2014.  This will hopefully allow for a quicker market recovery when the pandemic ebbs and trade returns towards normality in coming months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, commodity prices have been affected by the trade disruption and demand shock caused by the collapse of food services.</p>
<p>The table below shows that average EU average returns from product combinations relevant to the Irish product mix have come back by between 2.5 and 3.6c/l equivalent since early January (at which point they were on an upward trend). Spots for SMP and butter have come back further (4.6c/l), and this week’s trend for the Dutch products suggest further price decreases.  It is worth noting that an index such as the Ornua PPI, which reflects a combination of forward contracts, branded consumer products and other elements, has offered a good buffer against the short term trends – in fact, the Ornua PPI had been firming to February.  It is also worth reminding ourselves that the majority of co-ops have undershot the PPI for 18 months or more in the milk prices they have paid farmers.</p>
<p>However, as we write, the Ornua PPI for March is not yet available, and chances are that it will start to reflect a more difficult price situation, while still providing a buffer relative to the other indicators.</p>

Dairy Market Blog – 1st April 2020
Coronavirus affects markets in positive or negative ways – depending on whether you sell retail consumer product or not
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, dairy markets were headed for a positive 2020: modest milk supply growth, solid demand.
Things have changed, but not all for the bad.  We have seen a dual market impact to the outbreak of COVID-19: on the one hand, panic buying and a return to cooking at home have boosted retail sales in a significant way.  Though it must be said that even the initial stock piling has eased, and may militate against further purchases as the home stocks are consumed first.
On the other hand, the closure of restaurants and cafes has meant food service sales have crashed.  I remember a statement by Starbucks some years ago that they had just reached the point where they sold more milk than coffee, globally. Losing the coffee shop sector alone is a major blow to the sector.
The graphic below illustrates well the importance of the food services market to the dairy sector.
A study by AHDB Dairy UK in 2018, came to the conclusion that 51% of all meals eaten out in the UK included dairy, in either of the formats below, from dairy host meals (e.g. pizza or other take away), dairy as a (hidden) ingredients, hot beverages with milk, pure dairy as in ice cream or cold dairy drinks.

For dairy sectors which are mostly engaged on the domestic market, extra retail sales as people now eat and cook at home may have partly offset the food services downturn – indeed, there is some evidence that Irish milk processors involved in liquid milk are coming under pressure to ramp up volumes for retailers, which is a positive.
However, for most of the Irish dairy sector, which is export and business-to-business oriented, retail sales are not saving the day.
For exporters, there was also a significant physical disruption in trade caused by containers becoming stuck at ports, in China especially, either full or empty, but blocked in situ when lockdowns were preventing any work being carried out.  This has shown on Chinese powder imports especially (see below).  The situation was such that containers for global trade of ANY product were impossible to secure, with up to 6 weeks waiting times, and at significantly higher freight costs.
There are now signs that containers are moving again, but there are also concerns over product still in transit or storage having to be dealt with (consumed, or disposed of where the shelf life has to little to go) before any trade in fresh product can resume.
In addition, we have seen a lot of disruption even closer to home with border closures in Europe, though this has been somewhat mitigated by all European government and the EU instances agreeing to treat the food chain from farm to fork as an essential sector.
Stock have been building up, and food wastage has increased with a very sudden closure of the food services market either as a result of social distancing, or simply by mandated decision.
One other element to the disruption are shortages of inputs of which China would have been the source: certain food or feed ingredients, crop protection products, etc.  This has lifted the cost and reduced the availability of some of those products, to the detriment of the farming/food producing community globally, including in Europe.
The upshot of these major disruptions and the uncertainty created by the sheer overwhelming nature of the pandemic have led to dramatic falls in the world’s stock markets, in economic growth forecasts – some frankly catastrophic, possibly too much so! – and to negative price trends for the majority of commodities, from oil to food.
What’s happening to milk output?
Meanwhile, milk production globally is not expected to grow by much more than 1% against the 5-year average, according to Bord Bia.
2019 deliveries globally were only about 0.1% on 2018.
While there is some greater dynamism in the early months of 2020 in Europe and the US as the spring peak approaches – and how the spring output turns out in those two regions, with lower feed costs reported, will be crucial to global markets – it is somewhat offset by the impact of drought in the NI of New Zealand.

<p><span id=""more-20561""></span></p>
<p>IFA President Tim Cullinan said it’s recognised that keeping the food supply chain moving as freely as possible is a priority in managing the crisis.  However, he said the food chain will only work if it’s viable for all parts of the chain, including primary producers.</p>
<p>“The closure of the food service sector across Europe has hit Ireland disproportionately as we are an export country. While there has been an increase in retail sales across Europe, much of this is taken up by domestic suppliers who have surplus product due to food service closures in their country,” he said.</p>
<p>“We are facing massive challenges across all sectors, but the beef market is now in turmoil. We need significant measures urgently,” he said.</p>
<p>“Now is not the time for public rows, but I want to make it clear that the processing sector will have to take their share of the pain during this crisis. They cannot expect farmers to carry the can,” he said.</p>
<p>“We have sent this submission to the EU Agriculture Commissioner and the Minister for Agriculture who now has much more flexibility under State Aid rules. We appreciate that there lots of others who need support, but farmers cannot be forgotten,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Beef<br>
</br></strong><br>
The IFA has proposed that the EU CMO (Common Market Organisation) measures available under EU Regulation 1308/2013, Articles 219 to 221 must be immediately utilised to support farmers including:</br></p>
<ul>
<li>Direct payments for any price related market losses</li>
<li>Market supports in the form of specific and targeted APS.</li>
<li>EU Commission should move to protect the EU markets and prices, and suspend all non-EU beef imports.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sheep</strong></p>
<p>On the sheep sector, the COVID-19 crisis is having a very severe impact with the loss of major market segments and price down as much as €1/kg or up to €23 per lamb at farm level.</p>
<p>IFA is proposing EU action in the form of direct payment aid, APS market supports, suspension of non-EU imports and promotions.</p>
<p><strong>Dairy</strong></p>
<p>Irish milk production reaches peak at mid-May, with milk volumes building between now and then.</p>
<p>IFA believes a properly-designed, promptly-implemented Aid to Private Storage (APS) scheme would provide the best suited support for the dairy sector in the face of market disturbances caused by COVID-19, while also facilitating a prompt market recovery after the pandemic crisis comes to an end.</p>

“I am confident that if we all work together, and with some support from the EU Commission through APS support, we will get through this crisis,” he said.

<p>Covid-19 (the illness caused by the new Coronavirus) now permeates every aspect of our social, professional, cultural, sporting lives…  Is it any wonder, then, that it is also a major preoccupation for the dairy (and all other food) sectors?<br>
In this blog, we try to examine objectively, without hysteria, and bearing in mind that the situation evolves by the hour, what Covid-19 might mean for Irish dairy farmers in 2020.</br></p>
<p><strong>Modest increase in early 2020 milk supply growth to continue moderate, says Rabobank</strong></p>
<p>Global milk output had grown very moderately through 2019, which, outpaced by reasonable demand growth in both emerging and developed countries, contributed to a very positive market outlook for 2020.</p>
<p>The EU produced only 0.4% more milk in 2019 than in 2018, and the US only 0.3% more.  New Zealand was in the same ballpark, at +0.3% (calendar year) while Australia was down 4.3%.</p>
<p>Early 2020 saw a very modest recovery of production in Europe, with January output estimated up 1%, up 0.9% in the US, down 0.7% in New Zealand (although up 1.1% on a milk solids basis), and for the first time in 20 years (!) up 0.5% in Australia – this despite the fires and drought.</p>
<p>Trends for both New Zealand and Australia are for lower production over coming months, largely linked to weather/soil moisture issues.  Australian production relies substantially on irrigation, and recent droughts have increased the cost of water.  For New Zealand, Rabobank in its just published Q1 2020 Dairy Report states it has revised its 2019/20 output expectation to a fall of 1% compared to the previous full season.</p>
<p>The lower production in Oceania is undoubtedly offsetting to some extent the demand problems related to Covid-19 in China.</p>
<p>Rabo predicts that US milk production will return in 2020 back to its longer term growth trend of around 1.5%.</p>
<p>For the EU, a smaller herd with higher yields, and bearing in mind individual countries’ dynamics, Rabo has revised its prediction slightly up, and plumps for a 0.8% production increase for 2020.</p>
<p>All told the Rabo prediction is that while production will continue to grow globally, this growth will most likely remain well below 1% for 2020 and into 2021 – and for the second quarter of 2020 at least, it is based on low comparables in the previous year.</p>
<p>Relative moderation of supply will not offset a fall in demand, but it should help diminish its impact on farmers.<a href=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rabo-production-prediction.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-82244 lazy"" data-src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rabo-production-prediction.png"" height=""766"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""1105""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-82244"" height=""766"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rabo-production-prediction.png"" width=""1105""/></noscript></a></p>
<p>Source: Rabobank. <strong>Coronavirus upsets global trade and global economy</strong></p>
<p>Last December, Covid-19 appeared in China, which is our second most important export market for dairy after the UK, then globally, to finally be officially called a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11<sup>th</sup> March.</p>
<p>The impact of the efforts to contain the spread of the infection in China have affected demand (cities in lockdown, people no longer eating out, limited ability to go out for food shopping) but also supply chains (containers, full or empty, stuck at ports with staff unable to turn up for work to handle them and their contents, consequent global shortages of containers for trade, erosion of shelf life for product stuck in the chain, and likely delays to clear same when things return to normal – let’s nor forget that they will!…).</p>
<p>There is some evidence that, with China getting to somewhat better grips with the virus, the supply chain is starting to move again a little.  This is confirmed by Rabobank in its report, which states “Rabobank anticipates China’s consumer buying pattern to normalise by the second half of 2020, with evidence of improvement in some supply chains already visible”.  This view is confirmed by pigmeat operators in Ireland.</p>
<p>However, there are many factors at play which are causing concerns for the economy as a whole and dairy commodity markets in particular.</p>
<p>The slowdown in the Chinese economy associated with the extreme disruptions caused by the disease prevention measures had strongly reduced demand for oil.  Simultaneously, a supply and price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia has collapsed the price of crude oil to a current level of US$31.50/barrel (12<sup>th</sup> March 2020), around half of the price for most of 2019.</p>
<p>This is good for us at the petrol pump, but it affects the export income of many of the dairy importing countries which our important customers for us.<a href=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/oil-prices.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-82245 lazy"" data-src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/oil-prices.png"" height=""808"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""1024""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-82245"" height=""808"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/oil-prices.png"" width=""1024""/></noscript></a></p>
<p>Source: WTI Crude Oil Prices – www.macrotrends.net. This, and the announcements by the UK and the US of drastic measures in an effort to contain the virus have caused great jitters on stock markets, which fell on Monday 9<sup>th</sup> March, recovered somewhat on Tuesday 10<sup>th</sup>, only to fall even more dramatically on 11<sup>th</sup> March in reaction to Donald Trump’s announcement of restrictions on flights from Europe. Overnight on 12<sup>th</sup> March, the US Down Jones lost over 8%.</p>
<p>Rabobank and other analysts and commentators fear for the global economy, which already looked like slowing down for 2020, and expect sharp falls in oil prices could lead to a downturn, with global impact for food demand.  Also an issue are currency swings, as central banks in the EU, the US and beyond take measures to offset the difficulties caused by the Coronavirus (stimulus packages, interest cuts…).</p>

<p>Source: Dow Jones. Stock markets and commodity markets behave fundamentally the same, and the one thing they hate is uncertainty.  Nervousness leads to price decreases, and dairy commodity markets are no exception.</p>
<p>However, Rabobank advises that “global dairy commodity prices have already priced in the uncertainty – but a less-than-favourable expected finish to the New Zealand production season is providing some price support”.</p>
<p><strong>Dairy commodity price impact</strong></p>
<p>In recent weeks, average EU butter and powder market prices, as monitored and reported by the EU MMO (graph below) have weakened, with butter going down €100/t in the last month, and SMP around the same.  For all that, returns remain at around the level of milk price being paid by co-ops on average for 3.3% protein, 3.6% fat milk.</p>
<p>Cheese has held up pretty well, as has whey powder – both are important elements in our national product mix.<a href=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dairy-commodity-prices-EU.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-82247 lazy"" data-src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dairy-commodity-prices-EU.png"" height=""806"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""775""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-82247"" height=""806"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dairy-commodity-prices-EU.png"" width=""775""/></noscript></a></p>
<p>Data from EU MMO</p>
<p>Spot prices (first table below right) represent the price for a product available immediately, as opposed to an average price derived from a combination of contracts signed when market signals were more positive. They tend to anticipate market trends, and show the nervousness which Covid-19, falling oil prices and concerns over the global economy have caused.</p>
<p>Looking at the most recent available spot prices, the trend is not good: butter prices are €180/t lower than a month ago, and SMP prices over €200/t lower.  Let us bear in mind that very little product is traded on spots, and most Irish co-ops would have forward contracts at stronger prices at this point.  Spots, however, do indicate market trends.<a href=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/spot-quotes.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter wp-image-82248 lazy"" data-src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/spot-quotes.png"" height=""120"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""539""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter wp-image-82248"" height=""120"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/spot-quotes.png"" width=""539""/></noscript></a></p>

<p>It is important to remain as objective and calm as possible, and not talk ourselves into a worse crisis.  While there has been some weakness in prices in very recent weeks, the rising returns of prior months were not fully passed back to farmers, as IFA has evidenced in our regular blogs and market analyses.</p>
<p>In the interest of supporting farmers through a difficult spring, and not adding to the stresses caused by workload and increased costs – never mind the concerns for public health caused by Covid-19 –  we believe boards must at the very least hold firm on milk prices for the short to medium term.</p>

Coronavirus and Irish dairy
Covid-19 (the illness caused by the new Coronavirus) now permeates every aspect of our social, professional, cultural, sporting lives…  Is it any wonder, then, that it is also a major preoccupation for the dairy (and all other food) sectors?
In this blog, we try to examine objectively, without hysteria, and bearing in mind that the situation evolves by the hour, what Covid-19 might mean for Irish dairy farmers in 2020.
Modest increase in early 2020 milk supply growth to continue moderate, says Rabobank
Global milk output had grown very moderately through 2019, which, outpaced by reasonable demand growth in both emerging and developed countries, contributed to a very positive market outlook for 2020.
The EU produced only 0.4% more milk in 2019 than in 2018, and the US only 0.3% more.  New Zealand was in the same ballpark, at +0.3% (calendar year) while Australia was down 4.3%.
Early 2020 saw a very modest recovery of production in Europe, with January output estimated up 1%, up 0.9% in the US, down 0.7% in New Zealand (although up 1.1% on a milk solids basis), and for the first time in 20 years (!) up 0.5% in Australia – this despite the fires and drought.
Trends for both New Zealand and Australia are for lower production over coming months, largely linked to weather/soil moisture issues.  Australian production relies substantially on irrigation, and recent droughts have increased the cost of water.  For New Zealand, Rabobank in its just published Q1 2020 Dairy Report states it has revised its 2019/20 output expectation to a fall of 1% compared to the previous full season.
The lower production in Oceania is undoubtedly offsetting to some extent the demand problems related to Covid-19 in China.
Rabo predicts that US milk production will return in 2020 back to its longer term growth trend of around 1.5%.
For the EU, a smaller herd with higher yields, and bearing in mind individual countries’ dynamics, Rabo has revised its prediction slightly up, and plumps for a 0.8% production increase for 2020.
All told the Rabo prediction is that while production will continue to grow globally, this growth will most likely remain well below 1% for 2020 and into 2021 – and for the second quarter of 2020 at least, it is based on low comparables in the previous year.
Relative moderation of supply will not offset a fall in demand, but it should help diminish its impact on farmers.

Last December, Covid-19 appeared in China, which is our second most important export market for dairy after the UK, then globally, to finally be officially called a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11th March.
The impact of the efforts to contain the spread of the infection in China have affected demand (cities in lockdown, people no longer eating out, limited ability to go out for food shopping) but also supply chains (containers, full or empty, stuck at ports with staff unable to turn up for work to handle them and their contents, consequent global shortages of containers for trade, erosion of shelf life for product stuck in the chain, and likely delays to clear same when things return to normal – let’s nor forget that they will!…).
There is some evidence that, with China getting to somewhat better grips with the virus, the supply chain is starting to move again a little.  This is confirmed by Rabobank in its report, which states “Rabobank anticipates China’s consumer buying pattern to normalise by the second half of 2020, with evidence of improvement in some supply chains already visible”.  This view is confirmed by pigmeat operators in Ireland.
However, there are many factors at play which are causing concerns for the economy as a whole and dairy commodity markets in particular.
The slowdown in the Chinese economy associated with the extreme disruptions caused by the disease prevention measures had strongly reduced demand for oil.  Simultaneously, a supply and price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia has collapsed the price of crude oil to a current level of US$31.50/barrel (12th March 2020), around half of the price for most of 2019.
This is good for us at the petrol pump, but it affects the export income of many of the dairy importing countries which our important customers for us.

This, and the announcements by the UK and the US of drastic measures in an effort to contain the virus have caused great jitters on stock markets, which fell on Monday 9th March, recovered somewhat on Tuesday 10th, only to fall even more dramatically on 11th March in reaction to Donald Trump’s announcement of restrictions on flights from Europe. Overnight on 12th March, the US Down Jones lost over 8%.
Rabobank and other analysts and commentators fear for the global economy, which already looked like slowing down for 2020, and expect sharp falls in oil prices could lead to a downturn, with global impact for food demand.  Also an issue are currency swings, as central banks in the EU, the US and beyond take measures to offset the difficulties caused by the Coronavirus (stimulus packages, interest cuts…).

Source: Dow Jones. Stock markets and commodity markets behave fundamentally the same, and the one thing they hate is uncertainty.  Nervousness leads to price decreases, and dairy commodity markets are no exception.
However, Rabobank advises that “global dairy commodity prices have already priced in the uncertainty – but a less-than-favourable expected finish to the New Zealand production season is providing some price support”.
Dairy commodity price impact
In recent weeks, average EU butter and powder market prices, as monitored and reported by the EU MMO (graph below) have weakened, with butter going down €100/t in the last month, and SMP around the same.  For all that, returns remain at around the level of milk price being paid by co-ops on average for 3.3% protein, 3.6% fat milk.
Cheese has held up pretty well, as has whey powder – both are important elements in our national product mix.
Data from EU MMO
Spot prices (first table below right) represent the price for a product available immediately, as opposed to an average price derived from a combination of contracts signed when market signals were more positive. They tend to anticipate market trends, and show the nervousness which Covid-19, falling oil prices and concerns over the global economy have caused.
Looking at the most recent available spot prices, the trend is not good: butter prices are €180/t lower than a month ago, and SMP prices over €200/t lower.  Let us bear in mind that very little product is traded on spots, and most Irish co-ops would have forward contracts at stronger prices at this point.  Spots, however, do indicate market trends.

Data from EU MMO The Ornua PPI for February was also pretty much stable, returning the equivalent of 31.97 c/l + VAT (33.7c/l incl VAT).
In the table below, which considers the returns from the main dairy market indicators, we allow for a nominal 5c/l processing cost which we deduct before recording the price equivalent before VAT in the right column.  The exception to this is the Ornua PPI price equivalent, calculated by Ornua themselves with a 6.5c/l processing cost netted from it.
It is difficult to look too far ahead on dairy commodity price trends at the best of times, but these are most definitely not normal times.The impact on the global economy cannot be underestimated, but to quote Rabobank’s Q1 2020 Dairy Report again, “Rabobank anticipates China’s consumer buying pattern to normalise by the second half of 2020, with evidence of improvement in some supply chains already visible”.
We are certainly living through worrying times, with a lot of societal and global economic instability resulting from what is now officially a pandemic governments the world over struggle to try and gain control of.
It is important to remain as objective and calm as possible, and not talk ourselves into a worse crisis.  While there has been some weakness in prices in very recent weeks, the rising returns of prior months were not fully passed back to farmers, as IFA has evidenced in our regular blogs and market analyses.
In the interest of supporting farmers through a difficult spring, and not adding to the stresses caused by workload and increased costs – never mind the concerns for public health caused by Covid-19 –  we believe boards must at the very least hold firm on milk prices for the short to medium term.
We will get to the other side of this crisis.  Meanwhile, we all need to heed the advice of WHO https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public and the HSE https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/coronavirus/coronavirus.html to ensure we and our families remain safe and well.

<p>With spring calving now underway on many Irish farms, IFA National Farm Family Chairperson, Caroline Farrell has urged farmers to be particularly vigilant to ensure their own safety.</p>
<p>Heifers and cows can be unpredictable at calving time and may hit out without warning. Over the past 10 years livestock has accounted for 20% of farm fatalities, with the calving cow involved in over half of these fatalities.</p>
<p>The IFA Chair said, “The calving cow is the most dangerous animal on Irish farms and should not be trusted. Spring is the busiest time of year on many Irish farms. Farmers work around the clock, often needing to be up several times a night to check on animals. This can lead to severe tiredness, restricting a farmer’s ability to react quickly”.</p>
<p>The IFA has developed some useful tips for farmers to help keep them safe, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t be afraid to ask for help from a neighbour with a difficult cow or heifer</li>
<li>Know your limitations, you’re not as agile as you were this time last year</li>
<li>Make sure the calving gate is operating properly</li>
<li>Make sure the calving jack and ropes are fit for purpose</li>
<li>Cows are a prey animal and the maternal instinct of a cow is to protect her calf, especially after calving – make sure all dogs and children are out of sight before entering the pen</li>
<li>Make sure the cow is correctly locked into the calving gate</li>

<p><strong>Dairy market blog – 3rd February 2020</strong></p>
<p>Global milk supplies have been growing by less than 0.5% for most of 2019, and according to Rabobank’s Q4 Dairy Report, this trend will likely continue with growth of less than 1% through 2020 and possibly into 2021.</p>
<p>Ornua concludes that 2019 global milk supplies will likely be about on par with 2018.</p>
<p>Latest output trends in the EU have seen a fall off in Irish deliveries by 5.7% for December – though it should be remembered that the December 2018 figure was a massive increase on the previous December.  Output for Jan/Dec 2019 is up 5.2%, reaching (some expect exceeding) 8 bn litre.<a href=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Global-output.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81954 lazy"" data-src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Global-output.png"" height=""415"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""614""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81954"" height=""415"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Global-output.png"" width=""614""/></noscript></a></p>

<p>In Germany, milk collections are estimated down by 0.2% at this point of the season compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Early January collections in France were up modestly at around 0.6% with the season todate up around 0.4% compared to the same period.</p>
<p>UK supplies for the 2019/2020 season todate are 0.8% up on the previous period, with late January supplies down 1.4%. INTL FCStone estimate that the December supplies were down 1.1% and January 1.3%.</p>
<p>In all three cases, while the supplies are only modestly up, or even down, on the reference period, they tend to be higher than the 3 or 5 year average, so the underlying trend of growth remains, but it is very subdued.</p>
<p>New Zealand supplies for the calendar year 2019 were down 0.32% (milk solids), though up 0.2% in December and something similar in November.</p>
<p>US output was 0.9% up in December, but up only 0.3% for the calendar year 2019.</p>
<p>Subdued international milk output, coupled with somewhat better international demand, boosted by cheaper dairy products, is the main reason why, despite concerns over Brexit, and other international trade difficulties, dairy prices have not fallen as much as expected during 2019, and have even started to improve, especially for SMP, since August or so.</p>
<p><strong>Demand – impact of coronavirus and Brexit?</strong></p>
<p><strong>China </strong>has played a huge part in recent years in maintaining strong global dairy demand, as the comprehensive table below shows.  Since 2015, imports of bulk and packed milk has increased 81%, infant milk formula imports practically doubled, as did WMP.  SMP imports grew 72%.  Cheese, from low levels, rose 51% and butter rose by 60% by 2018, but has come back somewhat since.</p>
<p>Chinese consumers still have greater confidence in imported product, and the national capacity to produce more milk is in any case limited, especially by production costs.</p>

<p>The recent outbreak of the coronavirus, and the reaction to it, have seen entire regions closed down in an attempt to contain contagion.  As we write it is not clear how long it will take to first contain then fully treat/vaccinate the populations so that normal movement of people can resume.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, it is only to be expected that the movement of goods, indeed demand for goods, will be affected by the lock down.  What impact this might have on the global market for dairy will obviously depend on how soon the situation can be brought under control, then resolved.</p>
<p>Regarding <strong>Brexit</strong>, after approval by the UK and EU Parliaments of the Withdrawal Agreement, we have entered an 11-month transition period during which trading conditions will remain unaltered – so after a very uncertain 12 months, at least some short to medium term certainty.</p>
<p>That is not to say that there will not be plenty drama and political statements, as we already hear Boris Johnson say he will seek to diverge on a number of standards including labour, environmental and others, and Michel Barnier warn him that such statements will make trade negotiations difficult if not impossible.  Do expect possible fluctuations in the value of Sterling as markets take various views of the latest goings on, but no custom delays or tariffs until 31<sup>st</sup> December 2020, and after that only if we have a no-deal Brexit, or if we have a deal with includes some level of tariffs and requires some checks – and this is very likely.<strong>And yet, prices continue to firm</strong></p>
<p>Concerns over the Chinese situation  and Brexit aside, it looks like, after the quiet period which always follows Christmas, most dairy commodity indicators have resumed their firming trend.</p>
<p>EU spots have seen butter prices stabilise for some weeks at around €3600, while SMP has been inching its way first above €2500/t and now above €2600.  Whey is the biggest gainer, however, now breaching the €800/t.</p>

<p>EU average dairy prices show the same trend, with stable butter prices, rising SMP and whey powder prices.</p>
<p>Based on the prices reported for the EU average of the product mix most relevant for Ireland, gross returns for late January rose to nearly 38c/l, which is equivalent, after a 5c/l processing cost is deducted, to a milk price of 32.97c/l + VAT (34.75c/l incl VAT).</p>

Dairy market blog – 3rd February 2020
Global milk supplies have been growing by less than 0.5% for most of 2019, and according to Rabobank’s Q4 Dairy Report, this trend will likely continue with growth of less than 1% through 2020 and possibly into 2021.
Ornua concludes that 2019 global milk supplies will likely be about on par with 2018.
Latest output trends in the EU have seen a fall off in Irish deliveries by 5.7% for December – though it should be remembered that the December 2018 figure was a massive increase on the previous December.  Output for Jan/Dec 2019 is up 5.2%, reaching (some expect exceeding) 8 bn litre.

In Germany, milk collections are estimated down by 0.2% at this point of the season compared to the same period last year.
Early January collections in France were up modestly at around 0.6% with the season todate up around 0.4% compared to the same period.
UK supplies for the 2019/2020 season todate are 0.8% up on the previous period, with late January supplies down 1.4%. INTL FCStone estimate that the December supplies were down 1.1% and January 1.3%.
In all three cases, while the supplies are only modestly up, or even down, on the reference period, they tend to be higher than the 3 or 5 year average, so the underlying trend of growth remains, but it is very subdued.
New Zealand supplies for the calendar year 2019 were down 0.32% (milk solids), though up 0.2% in December and something similar in November.
US output was 0.9% up in December, but up only 0.3% for the calendar year 2019.
Subdued international milk output, coupled with somewhat better international demand, boosted by cheaper dairy products, is the main reason why, despite concerns over Brexit, and other international trade difficulties, dairy prices have not fallen as much as expected during 2019, and have even started to improve, especially for SMP, since August or so.
Demand – impact of coronavirus and Brexit?
China has played a huge part in recent years in maintaining strong global dairy demand, as the comprehensive table below shows.  Since 2015, imports of bulk and packed milk has increased 81%, infant milk formula imports practically doubled, as did WMP.  SMP imports grew 72%.  Cheese, from low levels, rose 51% and butter rose by 60% by 2018, but has come back somewhat since.
Chinese consumers still have greater confidence in imported product, and the national capacity to produce more milk is in any case limited, especially by production costs.

The recent outbreak of the coronavirus, and the reaction to it, have seen entire regions closed down in an attempt to contain contagion.  As we write it is not clear how long it will take to first contain then fully treat/vaccinate the populations so that normal movement of people can resume.
Meanwhile, however, it is only to be expected that the movement of goods, indeed demand for goods, will be affected by the lock down.  What impact this might have on the global market for dairy will obviously depend on how soon the situation can be brought under control, then resolved.
Regarding Brexit, after approval by the UK and EU Parliaments of the Withdrawal Agreement, we have entered an 11-month transition period during which trading conditions will remain unaltered – so after a very uncertain 12 months, at least some short to medium term certainty.
That is not to say that there will not be plenty drama and political statements, as we already hear Boris Johnson say he will seek to diverge on a number of standards including labour, environmental and others, and Michel Barnier warn him that such statements will make trade negotiations difficult if not impossible.  Do expect possible fluctuations in the value of Sterling as markets take various views of the latest goings on, but no custom delays or tariffs until 31st December 2020, and after that only if we have a no-deal Brexit, or if we have a deal with includes some level of tariffs and requires some checks – and this is very likely.And yet, prices continue to firm
Concerns over the Chinese situation  and Brexit aside, it looks like, after the quiet period which always follows Christmas, most dairy commodity indicators have resumed their firming trend.
EU spots have seen butter prices stabilise for some weeks at around €3600, while SMP has been inching its way first above €2500/t and now above €2600.  Whey is the biggest gainer, however, now breaching the €800/t.

Source: INTL FCStone
EU average dairy prices show the same trend, with stable butter prices, rising SMP and whey powder prices.
Based on the prices reported for the EU average of the product mix most relevant for Ireland, gross returns for late January rose to nearly 38c/l, which is equivalent, after a 5c/l processing cost is deducted, to a milk price of 32.97c/l + VAT (34.75c/l incl VAT).

Based on EU MMO data
The trend towards firmer commodity prices has also shown through the first 2 GDT auctions of 2020, which saw an uplift in the price index by 2.4% (7th Jan) and 1.7% (21st Jan) respectively.  At US$4250/t, the butter price is comfortably above the middle of the price range for the last 5 years.  SMP, at just over US$3000/t is at its highest for the same period.

Taking stock of all the relevant indicators since mid-August, we see a significant increase in the milk price equivalent they represent, with the EU MMO and EU spot SMP/butter combo returning over 5.4c/l more, the EU MMO full mix 3.32c/l and the Ornua PPI (to December 2019) a more modest 1.33c/l.  Meanwhile, a comparison of the average Farmers’ Journal Milk Price League for August 2019 with an estimate of December 2019 suggests an increase of only 0.33c/l – this is because many co-ops cut their milk price in August 2019, at a time when commodity returns had just bottomed out.

It is clear that there is scope for further milk price increases by Irish co-ops, after the modest price lifts (around 2c/l) applied in different ways for the October to December period.

<p>IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan said that the ‘Grass Fed standard’ developed by Bord Bia should only be considered by processors for certain products, if it’s guaranteed to deliver an extra margin in a particular market place.</p>
<p><span id=""more-20410""></span></p>
<p>Speaking at the launch he said, “To apply this verified standard for no return would be folly. Processors need to be sure it can be leveraged in the market place before applying it to any product lines. They must also ensure that the way in which they apply the standard does not devalue any individual farmer’s milk”.</p>
<p>He said it was important that co-ops would engage fully with their suppliers before deciding on applying the standard to any part of their milk pool.</p>
<p>“Most global customers generally understand that Irish cows are grass fed, but some international customers are looking for an official verified standard as others are making similar claims which are based on far fewer days at grass than we have in Ireland,” he said.</p>

<p>IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan today (Wed) said the move by Dairygold to pay 0.5c/l on all milk supplied during 2019 would be a welcome boost to their suppliers’ cash flow as calving begins.</p>
<p><span id=""more-20403""></span></p>
<p>“It shows IFA was correct in identifying scope for milk price increases when Dairygold and most other co-ops were paying significantly less than the Ornua PPI for much of 2019,” he said.</p>

<p>“IFA has shown co-ops have been conservative on milk prices, especially in the second half of 2019.  Milk price uplifts in October, November and December by most co-ops mean the gap with the December Ornua PPI has narrowed, though it remains negative at just under 0.5c/l.  In light of continued firming of EU and global commodity returns into January, farmers will legitimately expect further milk price increases before spring,” he concluded.</p>

<p>IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan led a delegation of Glanbia area County Dairy Chairmen to meet with Glanbia management.  Up for discussion was the latest Glanbia Fixed Price Scheme, which is proving very contentious with farmers and which they have just a week to apply.</p>
<p><span id=""more-20300""></span></p>
<p>The scheme comes with a major sting in the tail: to be granted volumes at the guaranteed 31c/l incl VAT for the year, farmers must tick a box committing them to trade with Glanbia Ireland to the value of at least 5 cents on their full 2020 supply.</p>
<p>“We appreciated our request for a meeting with Glanbia management being facilitated on short notice.  While Glanbia point out the scheme is voluntary, we have made it clear that farmers find the requirement to trade 5c/l with Glanbia on all milk coercive, and they are fearful that if they don’t reach that level, they simply will not get any volume,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“We in IFA have recognised and praised Glanbia’s innovation in providing farmers with the valuable income risk management instruments that are fixed milk price contracts. Glanbia have told us today that the majority of their suppliers already trade in excess of 5c/l with Glanbia.  Inflexibility on an unnecessary detail of the scheme cannot damage what should be a positive relationship with their farmer members,” he said.</p>
<p>“Glanbia Ireland is already providing input trading incentives and loyalty schemes to encourage farmers to do business with them.  Offering a good value service and competitively priced inputs should more than suffice to optimise their agribusiness trade,” he said.</p>
<p>“I urge Glanbia management, as was stated today, to take away our comments and reflect on them, and to apply flexibility on the trading requirement,” he concluded.</p>

The scheme comes with a major sting in the tail: to be granted volumes at the guaranteed 31c/l incl VAT for the year, farmers must tick a box committing them to trade with Glanbia Ireland to the value of at least 5 cents on their full 2020 supply.
“We appreciated our request for a meeting with Glanbia management being facilitated on short notice.  While Glanbia point out the scheme is voluntary, we have made it clear that farmers find the requirement to trade 5c/l with Glanbia on all milk coercive, and they are fearful that if they don’t reach that level, they simply will not get any volume,” Mr Phelan said.
“We in IFA have recognised and praised Glanbia’s innovation in providing farmers with the valuable income risk management instruments that are fixed milk price contracts. Glanbia have told us today that the majority of their suppliers already trade in excess of 5c/l with Glanbia.  Inflexibility on an unnecessary detail of the scheme cannot damage what should be a positive relationship with their farmer members,” he said.
“Glanbia Ireland is already providing input trading incentives and loyalty schemes to encourage farmers to do business with them.  Offering a good value service and competitively priced inputs should more than suffice to optimise their agribusiness trade,” he said.
“I urge Glanbia management, as was stated today, to take away our comments and reflect on them, and to apply flexibility on the trading requirement,” he concluded.

<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan said co-ops had failed to fairly reflect improved market returns for a few months.  This was angering farmers and could only be explained by co-ops’ rebuilding balance sheets after supporting farmers in 2018 and showing no ambition for spring 2020 milk prices.</p>
<p><span id=""more-20298""></span></p>
<p>The IFA National Dairy Committee will meet locally with their co-ops to challenge board members and management on their unfair milk pricing policies.</p>
<p>“Irish milk prices have lost touch with the European trends outlined in the LTO monthly league around May of 2018, and have underperformed massively ever since, with a fast widening gap now reaching up to 4c/l.  While European milk prices were stable, Irish co-ops were busy cutting our late spring and summer prices,” he said.</p>
<p>“Irish milk prices have even fallen behind the Ornua PPI with all co-ops, other than the West Cork Co-ops, paying less than that index for the majority of the last 12 months.  The October gap has widened to up to 2.5c/l, worth €1,050 on that month’s supplies for a 500,000-litre supplier,” he added.</p>
<p>“As a strategy to camouflage poor base milk prices, co-ops are now quoting them using average solids instead of the accepted standard.  They have also relied on ongoing volume growth to boost farmers’ monthly milk cheques.  This is hijacking farmers’ hard work, and is insulting to them.  The difference between October and March solids could be as much as 3.8c/l – that’s a cash-flow crippling €1,600 shortfall on March supplies for our 500,000-litre supplier,” he said.</p>
<p>“All the indicators IFA monitors have been firming for a few months, as a result of fast increasing powder prices, stable to firmer butter and cheese prices, all underpinned by a good global supply/demand balance looking set to last into 2020,” he added.</p>
<p>“Farmers cannot accept being short-changed on milk prices.  Co-op board members must realise that merchant credit bills due are draining farmers’ cash flow, as volumes stagnate relative to last autumn, and are now set to fall seasonally together with solids.  Board members and management teams must now outline their plans to improve milk prices this year end and before spring 2020,” he concluded.</p>

<p>In the last 20 years, the mean annual protein content of the milk produced by Irish dairy farmers has gone from 3.2% to 3.5%, while butterfat levels have gone from 3.7% to 4.2%.  Both constituents vary widely seasonally, with peak/trough differences of 0.6% for protein, and 1% for butterfat – the latter now unrestricted after the end of the quota regime.</p>
<p>Numerous co-ops have taken to quoting not only their standard price at 3.3% protein 3.6% butterfat, but also the price achievable in the relevant month at the co-op’s average constituents –especially so in autumn, when the constituents are at their seasonally highest levels.</p>
<p>Farmers have achieved those higher constituents through hard work, breeding, management and feeding, and have also grown volumes, also at a significant cost.  They are frustrated to see their hard work being hijacked.</p>

ARE OUR CO-OPS SHORTCHANGING US ON MILK PRICES?

Co-ops are using our improved constituents and growing volumes to camouflage poor milk prices

In the last 20 years, the mean annual protein content of the milk produced by Irish dairy farmers has gone from 3.2% to 3.5%, while butterfat levels have gone from 3.7% to 4.2%.  Both constituents vary widely seasonally, with peak/trough differences of 0.6% for protein, and 1% for butterfat – the latter now unrestricted after the end of the quota regime.
Numerous co-ops have taken to quoting not only their standard price at 3.3% protein 3.6% butterfat, but also the price achievable in the relevant month at the co-op’s average constituents –especially so in autumn, when the constituents are at their seasonally highest levels.
Farmers have achieved those higher constituents through hard work, breeding, management and feeding, and have also grown volumes, also at a significant cost.  They are frustrated to see their hard work being hijacked.

Co-ops have fallen behind the LTO average, and have not reflected the European
stable to firmer milk price trend in the last 6 months

Three Irish co-ops are included in the LTO monthly European milk price league: Dairygold, Glanbia and Kerry.  The LTO gathers milk statements from a small number of suppliers to each of the main milk purchasers in the main EU dairy countries.  Prices are measured in €/100kgs, and standardised at 3.4% protein and 4.2% butterfat.

Farmers cannot afford poor prices next spring!Merchant credit and other bills must get paid, and early heavy rain suggests a long costly winter and possibly spring ahead.Volumes are now stagnating versus last year, and constituents will dip at year end.Assuming no price changes from October, the March constituent levels will cost farmers around 3.8 cents per litre – that would be a cash-flow crippling €1600 shortfall on the March milk cheque for a 500,000-litre supplier.Our co-ops can, and must do better on milk prices this year end and next spring!

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The ambitious Government manifestos of Food Harvest 2020, followed by Food Wise 2025, set out targets for the growth of Irish milk production and export value at the end of the EU milk quota regime, to respond to a fast-growing global demand for sustainably produced dairy products.  Irish dairy farmers, and the co-operative processing sector, responded to the challenge, growing production, making investment on farms, in processing and in marketing to increase the volume and value of output and find new export outlets.</p>
<p>This strong growth has given rise to a number of challenges around sustainability, climate, and labour availability, all of which are being dealt with under various plans and initiatives.</p>
<p>In this paper, the National Dairy Committee proposes to focus on the issues of calf care and value to optimise the economic attractiveness and profitability of calves produced from the dairy herd for calf rearers and beef farmers.</p>
<p><strong>Dairy farmers take full responsibility for all the calves born in their herds</strong></p>
<p>The expansion of the dairy herd and the larger number of dairy calves it has given rise to, as well as the compact period in which they are marketed all put a strain on often insufficient farm facilities, in marts and create additional pressure on export capacity.</p>
<p>Dairy farmers have a vocation to raise and breed animals whose welfare coincides with their economic interests.  Beyond this, most have bred their cows over generations, and have a caring and empathetic relationship with them which goes well beyond treating them well because of their economic value.<br>
Farmers are very clear what constitutes best animal care practice on farms, and this includes zero tolerance to abusive treatment or cruelty towards animals.</br></p>
<p>Dairy farmers take the view that the dairy calves born from their herd are their responsibility, whether they are heifer calves they will retain as replacements, or male and female calves which will be fattened on or off the farm or exported.</p>
<p>However, it is essential that there would also be rigorous respect for animal welfare by the other stakeholders involved at every point along the chain when animals leave their farms for fattening on another farm, for later slaughter or for export.</p>
<p><strong>In order to ensure the maintenance of the highest animal care standards and to optimise the economic value of dairy calves into the beef chain, IFA proposes a package of measures as follows:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Action at farm level:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dairy farmers will take their full responsibility with regards to all calves born on their herds, and will seek to optimise calf care and health and minimise mortality through the <strong>use of best calf management and rearing practices</strong>. This must mean that the calf leaving the dairy farm has a real economic potential for whoever buys/rears on that calf.</li>
<li>Farmers will <strong>favour quality AI using bulls from the Dairy Beef Index recommended list</strong> to ensure a higher quality and value calf, and complete the breeding season only with pedigree stock bulls, improving the genetics being used. This is to ensure that the resulting calf is economically attractive to potential beef farmer buyers/rearers;</li>
<li><strong>Registration must be accurate</strong>, including the correct date of birth;</li>
<li>To spread out the current seasonal glut of calves coming to market over a short few weeks in spring, options should be explored to encourage farmers to hold calves longer on farms – bearing in mind the 42-day limitation for TB testing – or consider contract rearing. This must be supported through<strong> grant aiding of calf housing and feeding facilities including automatic calf feeders, </strong>through TAMS-type grants.  To be effective, those grants should apply over and above the TAMS maximum grant levels.</li>
<li><strong>Recourse to young calf slaughter facilities</strong> must only be used as an absolute last resort and be phased out;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Action at advisory/industry stakeholder level</strong></p>

<li>Communication with farmers in the coming months, through Discussion Groups, Teagasc advisory services, conferences and open days, Animal Health Ireland, and co-ops, must engage farmers on <strong>the use of best practice regarding the care of all calves born on their herds</strong>;</li>
<li>Based on the Teagasc Grange Dairy Beef project, Teagasc must produce and deliver a Dairy to Beef management and advisory template/course deliverable through Knowledge Transfer (KT) to support livestock farmers undertaking <strong>contract rearing or the straight purchasing of calves </strong>for later export and/or the veal/beef markets;</li>
<li><strong>One to one dairy and beef farmer partnerships </strong>should be encouraged<strong> to foster trust, contracts </strong>should be facilitated and<strong> a calf transaction platform </strong>developed to ascertain calf value based on quality, breed, sex and ICBF genetics information and to facilitate the flow of calves from dairy to beef farms. <strong>Marts have an integral part to play in this</strong>, providing information on weights, grading, price, and the logistics around transport.</li>

In this paper, the National Dairy Committee proposes to focus on the issues of calf care and value to optimise the economic attractiveness and profitability of calves produced from the dairy herd for calf rearers and beef farmers.
Dairy farmers take full responsibility for all the calves born in their herds
The expansion of the dairy herd and the larger number of dairy calves it has given rise to, as well as the compact period in which they are marketed all put a strain on often insufficient farm facilities, in marts and create additional pressure on export capacity.
Dairy farmers have a vocation to raise and breed animals whose welfare coincides with their economic interests.  Beyond this, most have bred their cows over generations, and have a caring and empathetic relationship with them which goes well beyond treating them well because of their economic value.
Farmers are very clear what constitutes best animal care practice on farms, and this includes zero tolerance to abusive treatment or cruelty towards animals.
Dairy farmers take the view that the dairy calves born from their herd are their responsibility, whether they are heifer calves they will retain as replacements, or male and female calves which will be fattened on or off the farm or exported.
However, it is essential that there would also be rigorous respect for animal welfare by the other stakeholders involved at every point along the chain when animals leave their farms for fattening on another farm, for later slaughter or for export.

Recourse to young calf slaughter facilities must only be used as an absolute last resort and be phased out;

 
Action at advisory/industry stakeholder level

Communication with farmers in the coming months, through Discussion Groups, Teagasc advisory services, conferences and open days, Animal Health Ireland, and co-ops, must engage farmers on the use of best practice regarding the care of all calves born on their herds;
Based on the Teagasc Grange Dairy Beef project, Teagasc must produce and deliver a Dairy to Beef management and advisory template/course deliverable through Knowledge Transfer (KT) to support livestock farmers undertaking contract rearing or the straight purchasing of calves for later export and/or the veal/beef markets;
One to one dairy and beef farmer partnerships should be encouraged to foster trust, contracts should be facilitated and a calf transaction platform developed to ascertain calf value based on quality, breed, sex and ICBF genetics information and to facilitate the flow of calves from dairy to beef farms. Marts have an integral part to play in this, providing information on weights, grading, price, and the logistics around transport.

An information and advisory campaign must be undertaken by Teagasc, conveyed through discussion groups, beef factories and dairy co-ops to challenge mindsets and highlight the economic value of the dairy calf to beef system.
The importance to the dairy sector’s image of what happens on farms is critical to our dairy export industry. Co-ops have a big part to play in protecting our brand, by engaging directly with farmers on this topic.
Incentivisation through the type of joint scheme undertaken by Glanbia and Kepak (Twenty/20) would help change mindsets and encourage participation;
Research must continue on sexed semen and the best practice to optimise its cost efficiency on Irish farms, with the establishment of an Irish laboratory. This must be accompanied by a strong advisory campaign to encourage and support farmers in using it;
The rate of genetic improvement achieved through the EBI in the dairy sector must be replicated in the recently launched ICBF Dairy Beef Index (DBI). An advisory campaign must be developed and delivered through Teagasc and co-ops to optimise its use and value on farms.

Action at Government level:

Grants (TAMS-type) must be made available to farmers to help them develop calf rearing facilities. These should apply in addition to the maximum TAMS levels;
DAFM must appropriately police the sales and handling of calves through marts. Only healthy, hardy calves fit for transport and sale must be brought by farmers to marts;

DAFM must also insist that Irish exporters, and through their French authority counterparts lairage operators, provide adequate training of all staff in contact with or with responsibility for handling calves regarding their proper welfare treatment in loading, off-loading, transit, and on feeding and resting.

Conclusion
The success of the Irish dairy sector expansion and the increased exports of top-quality dairy products which consumers the world over can trust depends on every aspects of its sustainability.
Consumers the world over increasingly want to know that the dairy products they consume are produced not just healthfully and environmentally responsibly, but also ethically from an animal welfare point of view.
Bearing in mind that a substantial portion of the beef produced in Ireland originates from the dairy herd, it also behoves dairy farmers to ensure best calf husbandry, quality and value to maximise the economic returns to beef farmers further down the line.
As farmers, while we already do well, we need to continue to improve our performance on all those fronts.

<p>Speaking today at the IFA Retail Event, addressed by UK Groceries Code Adjudicator Christine Tacon, IFA National Liquid Milk Chairman John Finn said the first condition for farmers to get a fair price from the retail chain was for retailers to pay a wholesale price which guarantees a return for farmers.</p>
<p><span id=""more-20249""></span></p>
<p>He told Ms Tacon that Irish retailers simply pay dairies too little for liquid milk.  “Dairies need to negotiate harder, but retailers must take their responsibility to secure fairness and the sustainability of suppliers.  If they fail to do so, I for one would like to see regulation forcing them to.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Our liquid milk producers are a 10% minority specialised to supply the fresh retail milk market year-round, and their production costs are substantially higher than that of the majority of creamery milk producers.  IFA has demonstrated that they need a minimum of 40c/l on average across the year to cover their costs and reward their own labour with a modest wage,” Mr Finn said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“In the last couple of years, farmers have received an annual average price for their liquid milk between six and eight cents a litre below this break-even level.  They need to be able to secure better winter payments to deal with the much higher cost of keeping cows producing fresh milk over the winter months, and dairies must deliver those right now,” he added.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Kantar World Panel figures suggest that the average retail price for all types of liquid milk is 94c/l, with private label milk averaging 78c/l.  This clearly allows for a major shift in margins to pay more to dairies, allowing them to pass on to farmers the stronger winter price they need,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We need our dairies to negotiate harder, but we also need legislation that forces retailers to take responsibility for the fair treatment of primary food producers,” he concluded.</p>

“In the last couple of years, farmers have received an annual average price for their liquid milk between six and eight cents a litre below this break-even level.  They need to be able to secure better winter payments to deal with the much higher cost of keeping cows producing fresh milk over the winter months, and dairies must deliver those right now,” he added.
 
“Kantar World Panel figures suggest that the average retail price for all types of liquid milk is 94c/l, with private label milk averaging 78c/l.  This clearly allows for a major shift in margins to pay more to dairies, allowing them to pass on to farmers the stronger winter price they need,” he said.
 
“We need our dairies to negotiate harder, but we also need legislation that forces retailers to take responsibility for the fair treatment of primary food producers,” he concluded.

<p><strong>Dairy markets: stable or stagnant?</strong></p>
<p>At the 19<sup>th</sup> September meeting of the EU Milk Market Observatory Economic Board, where I was representing COPA, this question was asked.  With supply and demand in reasonable balance, why are farmer milk prices stagnant (in fact, falling in Ireland!)?</p>
<p>We have been repeating it for months: milk output growth among the most important dairy regions has been very modest.  Low private powder stocks and empty intervention, though butter stocks have been higher, have only contributed in a limited way to available supplies.</p>
<p>Combined with reasonably solid demand from the likes of China and other Asian countries as well as within the US and the EU, we definitely have a balanced dairy market.</p>
<p><strong>Low milk supply growth – except for New Zealand’s very early season</strong></p>
<p>January to July output for the main 4 milk production region remains in negative territory, at just under 0%.  January to June production fell 0.5%, with particularly negative trends in Oceania and South America.  Expectations from the EU Commission’s analysis suggests that production will grow very moderately for the second half of 2019.</p>
<p>For the two trough months of June and July, <strong>New Zealand</strong> production has increased substantially, by 14% in June (absolute trough) and just under 5% for July, while August output went up by 2.22% (milk solids – actual volume was only up 0.8%).  Rabobank predicts a full 2019/20 season output for New Zealand between -1% and +1%, depending on spring weather patterns over the next number of weeks coming to the October peak.<a href=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Global-supplies.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81011 lazy"" data-src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Global-supplies.jpg"" height=""445"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""698""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81011"" height=""445"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Global-supplies.jpg"" width=""698""/></noscript></a></p>
<p>Source: EU MMO</p>
<p><strong>US</strong> milk supplies were flat for the first half of 2019.  For July and August, output was up only 0.2% compared to the same months in 2018.</p>
<p>Things don’t look good for the future either:  cow numbers are down, and there are dire reports of farmers going out of business – with predictions that 10% of the state’s dairy farmers may go bankrupt in 2019 (40% shut down in the last decade).</p>
<p>Farm Aid concerts involving the likes of Willie Nelson and Neil Young have sought to highlight the plight of US dairy farmers.</p>
<p>The causes: low milk prices, and the US administration’s trade and tariff policy which have hampered the US’s ability to export, and resulted in a glut of milk at home.  Exports of cheese and other dairy products to China and Mexico have been hampered by countervailing tariffs.  Also, soy beans which used to be imported relatively cheaply from China are no longer available as cheaply, so costs have also increased and margins on farms have been squeezed.</p>
<p>Federal aid packages do not appear to have sufficed to compensate farmers for the disastrous impact.</p>
<p><strong>EU</strong> milk production has also been relatively flat this year so far, with soil moisture deficits in the late spring and summer the main factors.  January to July milk supplies grew only 0.2% (+0.3% for July alone), with Rabobank predicting continued moderate if any growth at all to spring 2020, largely because of tight forage and feed availability and quality expected to continue impacting into winter.</p>
<p>The EU Commission predicts a full-year 2019 milk production increase of only 0.5% compared to the prior year, with strong positive outcomes in Ireland, the UK, Poland and Belgium, and reduced output in France, the Netherlands and Italy, and stable production trends in Germany.</p>

<p>SMP stocks – which are now entirely private, as intervention is long empty – are calculated by adding up production + imports and subtracting consumption + export.  Both EDA and the EU Commission expect SMP stocks to tighten even further into 2020, as a result of lower production and very strong exports throughout 2019 to date.<a href=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EU-estimates-SMP-stocks.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81012 lazy"" data-src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EU-estimates-SMP-stocks.png"" height=""803"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""991""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81012"" height=""803"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EU-estimates-SMP-stocks.png"" width=""991""/></noscript></a>This is expected to have a positive impact on SMP prices, and this is also showing in current average prices, spot and futures quotes (see below).</p>

<p><strong>Demand – EU exports, Chinese imports and global trade all continue strong</strong></p>
<p>The EU Commission’s latest EU MMO report confirms that global demand has been solid, with the exception of whey products.  Expectations are for a quieter second half on global trade, partly due to the strong buying in the first half.</p>
<p>EU exports of butter and skimmed milk powder have increased massively in 2019 thus far.</p>
<p>Within a global SMP exports increase of over 6%, EU SMP exports show record growth figures, up a huge 30.6% for the first half of 2019, but the EU Commission warns that trade could slow down as prices increase.</p>
<p>EU butter is competitive in world markets, resulting in 7.4% export growth in H1 2019, and a massive 90% increase in July alone.</p>
<p>EU Cheese exports grew more modestly in H1 2019, by 0.9%, but in the context of global cheese exports rising by 3.7% for the same period.</p>
<p>Where the EU lost ground is in WMP exports, which fell by nearly 22% compared to the first half of 2018, in the context of global export increases of 7.1%, mostly benefiting New Zealand.</p>
<p>Demand in China remains strong, with imports continuing for the Jan-Jul 2019 period on the strong growth trend of the last three years.  This is especially true for milk powders (both SMP and WMP) and infant formula. For cheese, China is now the 6<sup>th</sup> world importer, coming close to South Korea. Chinese butter imports have dropped, to the detriment of New Zealand.</p>
<p>US imports have surged this year, notably for butter (+46%).  What will happen to these in the tariff war between the US and China in the coming months remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The whey powder market is highly influenced by the effects of African Swine Fever in China, as this has reduced the national pig herd, consumer of whey based feed, by a third todate – with predictions that culling due to the disease could halve the herd by year end.  With China accounting for 50% of world pig production, this is an event of true global scale.<br>
Combined whey exports from global traders have contracted by 13% (-4% for the EU). Yet, EU exports of whey powder to China have increased this year.<a href=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chinese-imports.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81016 lazy"" data-src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chinese-imports.png"" height=""551"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""876""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81016"" height=""551"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chinese-imports.png"" width=""876""/></noscript></a></br></p>

<p>In the butter market, high stock levels keep prices relatively low and therefore encourage trade flows.  Global butter exports grew 6.6% in the Jan-Jun period, and within that, EU butter exports performed even better, with an increase of 7.4%.</p>
<p>Top destination of EU butter exports was the US, with over 17,000t exported in the first half, This year.  In the Airbus v Boeing EU v US WTO dispute, WTO gave the US the right to impose countervailing import tariffs on dairy products (butter and cheese in particular) which we understand could come into play from October, and upset an otherwise growing trade (including hugely successful and high value Kerrygold butter exports!).  Watch this space.</p>
<p>Another interesting element in the examination of global butter exports is India, the single largest milk producing country in the world, which emerges as a major butter exporter, with sizeable volumes shipped to Turkey.</p>
<p><strong>Despite market balance looking set to last medium term at least, sentiment affected by global trade and economic uncertainty</strong></p>
<p>With market in balance, what is worrying operators?  According to the EU MMO report from last week:</p>
<p>“Market fundamentals for dairy remain positive and global markets are in relatively good balance due to reduced milk output and strong demand.  Sentiment is weakened by Brexit, other geo-political uncertainty factors and worsening trade conflict”</p>
<p><strong>And yet… dairy prices are firming</strong></p>
<p>EU butter prices have fallen by a massive 30% in the last 12 months, but have stabilised somewhat since mid-August, even with some firming.</p>

<p>Even overall returns for current average dairy market prices have improved, especially SMP and WMP, but also cheese.  While butter had firmed a little in recent week, it has eased a little in the most recent week.</p>
<p>For all that, the Irish product mix return, at EU average price levels, would yield a gross 35.07c/l before processing costs, slightly above what it has been in recent weeks, and equivalent to a milk price of 30.07c/l + VAT after deduction of a nominal 5c/l for processing costs.  This would be equivalent to a VAT inclusive 31.7c/l – that’s around 1.6c/l more than the simple average of the August milk prices paid by Irish co-ops, as recorded in the Farmers’ Journal milk league.<a href=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/returns-from-Irish-product-mix.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81019 lazy"" data-src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/returns-from-Irish-product-mix.png"" height=""304"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""552""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81019"" height=""304"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/returns-from-Irish-product-mix.png"" width=""552""/></noscript></a></p>
<p>Based on EU MMO data</p>
<p>Considering all the main indicators we monitor on an ongoing basis (EU MMO averages, spots, futures, GDT, Ornua PPI), we have to note that, apart from the Ornua PPI, which would return, for August milk, the equivalent of 29.22c/l + VAT (30.8c/l incl VAT), all other indicators would return an Irish milk price equivalent net of VAT in excess of 30c/l – a not insignificant improvement in recent weeks.<a href=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/REturns-from-main-indicators.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81020 lazy"" data-src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/REturns-from-main-indicators.png"" height=""224"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""614""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81020"" height=""224"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/REturns-from-main-indicators.png"" width=""614""/></noscript></a></p>
<p><strong>European milk prices are stable… yet Irish milk prices have been falling</strong></p>
<p>EU MMO reports and LTO reports agree: EU average milk prices have stabilised in recent months, and look set to at worst stay firm for the medium term at least, in light of the fact that markets are well balanced.</p>
<p>The EU MMO reported average EU milk producer price as in the graph below shows stability for the last three months at around €33.5/100 kgs.<a href=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Average-EU-milk-prices.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81021 lazy"" data-src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Average-EU-milk-prices.png"" height=""548"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""831""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81021"" height=""548"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Average-EU-milk-prices.png"" width=""831""/></noscript></a></p>

<p>Irish milk prices, on the other hand, have been falling in recent months, with most co-ops applying cuts of between 2c/l and 3.3c/l since January (there was also some small cuts by some co-ops last November), so that we estimate the current(August) 3.3% protein, 3.6% fat Farmers Journal league simple average would work out at around 28.5c/l + VAT (30.04c/l incl VAT).  This average is however heavily influenced by the West Cork Co-ops, and some of the main milk purchasers are paying just over 27c/l + VAT (28.5c/l incl VAT).</p>
<p>For the last EU MMO Economic Board meeting, our LTO colleagues have released their July milk price review ranked by price, and it clearly shows the three Irish co-ops included in the review, Glanbia, Dairygold and Kerry, firmly at the bottom.<br>
It is worth noting that most milk purchasers are holding their milk prices for August and September, and that the gap between the LTO average and the price paid by two out of three Irish co-ops included has widened further as both Glanbia and Dairygold have cut their August milk price.<br>
This brings the gap between Irish milk purchasers and the average LTO price to €2.93/100 kgs, leaving Irish dairy farmers at a unique disadvantage relative to their European counterparts.<a href=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LTO-league-July-19.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81022 lazy"" data-src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LTO-league-July-19.png"" height=""489"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""784""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81022"" height=""489"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LTO-league-July-19.png"" width=""784""/></noscript></a></br></br></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: Rabobank predicts supply/demand balance could even past spring 2020</strong></p>
<p>The Dairy Quarterly Q3 2019 report, published last week by Rabobank, concludes that, despite slowing global economic activity and uncertainty, “the outlook for demand growth is more than enough to absorb the modest volumes of increasing milk flows, and the current general firmness in global markets is expected to remain through mid-2020”.</p>
<p><strong>This should help make Irish co-ops rethink their pricing policy over the coming months!</strong></p>
<p>The following is the Rabobank summary view on the factors which will be relevant to dairy markets in each of the main regions:<a href=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rabo-regional.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81023 lazy"" data-src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rabo-regional.png"" height=""655"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""822""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-81023"" height=""655"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rabo-regional.png"" width=""822""/></noscript></a></p>

Dairy markets: stable or stagnant?
At the 19th September meeting of the EU Milk Market Observatory Economic Board, where I was representing COPA, this question was asked.  With supply and demand in reasonable balance, why are farmer milk prices stagnant (in fact, falling in Ireland!)?
We have been repeating it for months: milk output growth among the most important dairy regions has been very modest.  Low private powder stocks and empty intervention, though butter stocks have been higher, have only contributed in a limited way to available supplies.
Combined with reasonably solid demand from the likes of China and other Asian countries as well as within the US and the EU, we definitely have a balanced dairy market.
Low milk supply growth – except for New Zealand’s very early season
January to July output for the main 4 milk production region remains in negative territory, at just under 0%.  January to June production fell 0.5%, with particularly negative trends in Oceania and South America.  Expectations from the EU Commission’s analysis suggests that production will grow very moderately for the second half of 2019.
For the two trough months of June and July, New Zealand production has increased substantially, by 14% in June (absolute trough) and just under 5% for July, while August output went up by 2.22% (milk solids – actual volume was only up 0.8%).  Rabobank predicts a full 2019/20 season output for New Zealand between -1% and +1%, depending on spring weather patterns over the next number of weeks coming to the October peak.
Source: EU MMO
US milk supplies were flat for the first half of 2019.  For July and August, output was up only 0.2% compared to the same months in 2018.
Things don’t look good for the future either:  cow numbers are down, and there are dire reports of farmers going out of business – with predictions that 10% of the state’s dairy farmers may go bankrupt in 2019 (40% shut down in the last decade).
Farm Aid concerts involving the likes of Willie Nelson and Neil Young have sought to highlight the plight of US dairy farmers.
The causes: low milk prices, and the US administration’s trade and tariff policy which have hampered the US’s ability to export, and resulted in a glut of milk at home.  Exports of cheese and other dairy products to China and Mexico have been hampered by countervailing tariffs.  Also, soy beans which used to be imported relatively cheaply from China are no longer available as cheaply, so costs have also increased and margins on farms have been squeezed.
Federal aid packages do not appear to have sufficed to compensate farmers for the disastrous impact.
EU milk production has also been relatively flat this year so far, with soil moisture deficits in the late spring and summer the main factors.  January to July milk supplies grew only 0.2% (+0.3% for July alone), with Rabobank predicting continued moderate if any growth at all to spring 2020, largely because of tight forage and feed availability and quality expected to continue impacting into winter.
The EU Commission predicts a full-year 2019 milk production increase of only 0.5% compared to the prior year, with strong positive outcomes in Ireland, the UK, Poland and Belgium, and reduced output in France, the Netherlands and Italy, and stable production trends in Germany.
Stocks of powder low in EU, butter stocks less so
SMP stocks – which are now entirely private, as intervention is long empty – are calculated by adding up production + imports and subtracting consumption + export.  Both EDA and the EU Commission expect SMP stocks to tighten even further into 2020, as a result of lower production and very strong exports throughout 2019 to date.This is expected to have a positive impact on SMP prices, and this is also showing in current average prices, spot and futures quotes (see below).

Privately held butter stocks, calculated on the same basis,  are estimated by the EU Commission to be between 20,000t and 70,000t above last year.  EDA (graphs below) reflect this.  This is high-ish, or more accurately either within normal variations or high, and undoubtedly contributes to keeping a bit of a lid on butter prices.  The two graphs below outline EDA’s low and high estimates of butter stock.

Demand – EU exports, Chinese imports and global trade all continue strong
The EU Commission’s latest EU MMO report confirms that global demand has been solid, with the exception of whey products.  Expectations are for a quieter second half on global trade, partly due to the strong buying in the first half.
EU exports of butter and skimmed milk powder have increased massively in 2019 thus far.
Within a global SMP exports increase of over 6%, EU SMP exports show record growth figures, up a huge 30.6% for the first half of 2019, but the EU Commission warns that trade could slow down as prices increase.
EU butter is competitive in world markets, resulting in 7.4% export growth in H1 2019, and a massive 90% increase in July alone.
EU Cheese exports grew more modestly in H1 2019, by 0.9%, but in the context of global cheese exports rising by 3.7% for the same period.
Where the EU lost ground is in WMP exports, which fell by nearly 22% compared to the first half of 2018, in the context of global export increases of 7.1%, mostly benefiting New Zealand.
Demand in China remains strong, with imports continuing for the Jan-Jul 2019 period on the strong growth trend of the last three years.  This is especially true for milk powders (both SMP and WMP) and infant formula. For cheese, China is now the 6th world importer, coming close to South Korea. Chinese butter imports have dropped, to the detriment of New Zealand.
US imports have surged this year, notably for butter (+46%).  What will happen to these in the tariff war between the US and China in the coming months remains to be seen.
The whey powder market is highly influenced by the effects of African Swine Fever in China, as this has reduced the national pig herd, consumer of whey based feed, by a third todate – with predictions that culling due to the disease could halve the herd by year end.  With China accounting for 50% of world pig production, this is an event of true global scale.
Combined whey exports from global traders have contracted by 13% (-4% for the EU). Yet, EU exports of whey powder to China have increased this year.

Cheddar cheese, peaked last April for 2019, and have since stabilised above €3050/t.
Whey powder prices have been weak, reflecting global poor trade (see above) linked to lower demand from China.

Spot quotes and futures quotes do suggest some more positivity ahead, though, reflecting a well-balanced supply-demand situation likely to last into next spring, according to the Rabobank Q3 2019 Dairy Quarterly report published last week.

Even overall returns for current average dairy market prices have improved, especially SMP and WMP, but also cheese.  While butter had firmed a little in recent week, it has eased a little in the most recent week.
For all that, the Irish product mix return, at EU average price levels, would yield a gross 35.07c/l before processing costs, slightly above what it has been in recent weeks, and equivalent to a milk price of 30.07c/l + VAT after deduction of a nominal 5c/l for processing costs.  This would be equivalent to a VAT inclusive 31.7c/l – that’s around 1.6c/l more than the simple average of the August milk prices paid by Irish co-ops, as recorded in the Farmers’ Journal milk league.
Based on EU MMO data
Considering all the main indicators we monitor on an ongoing basis (EU MMO averages, spots, futures, GDT, Ornua PPI), we have to note that, apart from the Ornua PPI, which would return, for August milk, the equivalent of 29.22c/l + VAT (30.8c/l incl VAT), all other indicators would return an Irish milk price equivalent net of VAT in excess of 30c/l – a not insignificant improvement in recent weeks.
European milk prices are stable… yet Irish milk prices have been falling
EU MMO reports and LTO reports agree: EU average milk prices have stabilised in recent months, and look set to at worst stay firm for the medium term at least, in light of the fact that markets are well balanced.
The EU MMO reported average EU milk producer price as in the graph below shows stability for the last three months at around €33.5/100 kgs.

Irish milk prices, on the other hand, have been falling in recent months, with most co-ops applying cuts of between 2c/l and 3.3c/l since January (there was also some small cuts by some co-ops last November), so that we estimate the current(August) 3.3% protein, 3.6% fat Farmers Journal league simple average would work out at around 28.5c/l + VAT (30.04c/l incl VAT).  This average is however heavily influenced by the West Cork Co-ops, and some of the main milk purchasers are paying just over 27c/l + VAT (28.5c/l incl VAT).
For the last EU MMO Economic Board meeting, our LTO colleagues have released their July milk price review ranked by price, and it clearly shows the three Irish co-ops included in the review, Glanbia, Dairygold and Kerry, firmly at the bottom.
It is worth noting that most milk purchasers are holding their milk prices for August and September, and that the gap between the LTO average and the price paid by two out of three Irish co-ops included has widened further as both Glanbia and Dairygold have cut their August milk price.
This brings the gap between Irish milk purchasers and the average LTO price to €2.93/100 kgs, leaving Irish dairy farmers at a unique disadvantage relative to their European counterparts.

Conclusion: Rabobank predicts supply/demand balance could even past spring 2020
The Dairy Quarterly Q3 2019 report, published last week by Rabobank, concludes that, despite slowing global economic activity and uncertainty, “the outlook for demand growth is more than enough to absorb the modest volumes of increasing milk flows, and the current general firmness in global markets is expected to remain through mid-2020”.
This should help make Irish co-ops rethink their pricing policy over the coming months!
The following is the Rabobank summary view on the factors which will be relevant to dairy markets in each of the main regions:

<p>Speaking at the National Ploughing Championships, IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan challenged co-ops to address farmers’ questions as to why are milk prices falling, and why have they fallen so much behind European levels.</p>
<p><span id=""more-20115""></span></p>
<p>Is it because of Brexit, is it because of markets, is it because of supplies?  Why is the gap between the PPI and the price co-ops pay farmers widening? Farmers need answers, they need to plan ahead.</p>
<p>“Average EU dairy market returns, spots and futures have all been inching up in recent weeks.  Friesland Campina, one of the largest European co-ops which buys milk across borders have held their €35/100 kgs (30.57c/l Irish equivalent) price for July to September.   For Arla, another major co-op buying milk in several member states, September was the 8<sup>th</sup> month of stability.  So why have Irish co-ops been cutting milk prices several times since the beginning of 2019?” Mr Phelan asked.</p>
<p>“Well respected Europe-wide, the LTO monthly milk price review is published by Dutch farm organisation LTO, and includes three Irish co-ops, Dairygold, Glanbia and Kerry. In the last year, the gap between the average of the LTO review and the average paid by the three Irish co-ops has increased from €1.3/100 kgs in July 18 to €3.6/100 kgs in July 19.  While overall milk price levels have eased over that period, European averages have clearly stabilised since March, yet Irish prices have continued to dip, especially in the last couple of months,” he said.</p>
<p>“We recognise that markets have eased in the last year, however Irish milk prices seem to have fallen more than most.  Irish co-ops have been diverging away from European pricing trends and undershooting the Ornua PPI for the majority of the last 11 months.  It is no wonder Irish farmers are asking questions: co-ops must now answer them and make solid commitments on milk prices for the rest of the year,” he concluded.</p>

<p><strong>Supply growth remains subdued, but nervous sentiments impacts prices</strong></p>
<p>It’s a bit of a broken record among dairy market analysts: milk output growth globally has remained very subdued – which should underpin better dairy prices –  yet markets are sluggish with easier butter prices the main characteristic.</p>
<p>Global milk production is actually down, estimated at -0.4% for Jan to June, with weak supplies in the US,  Australia and South America.  The new 2019/2020 NZ season looks set for a strong start, with June supplies up around 13% in milk solids terms.  However, June is the trough month, and in 2018 accounted for less than 1% of milk solids production for the full year.</p>
<p>EU production is only very modestly up (only +0.4% for Jan-June), but hides differing trends.  Hence, France’s negative production trend remains negative, but less so, while German production, rising in the first quarter, has been falling every month since.  Dutch milk output continues down (-2.7%) as last year’s herd reduction scheme continues to impact.  Between them, these 3 countries account for around 45% of all EU milk production.</p>
<p>Other countries expanded production, not least Ireland, +10% for the Jan to June period, the UK (+3%) and while Poland had been growing its production fast up till now, it has just registered it first negative since late 2016 in June, down 0.5% compared to the same month last year.</p>
<p>The main problem comes from demand-side factors.</p>
<p><strong>Weaker economic growth</strong></p>
<p>Global economic growth has been easing for some months now, with particular reports from the Eurozone, the US and China.  The IMF has for some time been flagging its concerns about a possible global recession, urging the US and China to resolve their trade skirmishes, and have now reduced their growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Global dairy demand is a mixed bag</strong></p>
<p>In simple terms, demand is more buoyant in (some) developing countries than in the developed world.  Hence, demand is relatively sluggish in the EU, while it is reported strong to very strong in Asia (including China).</p>
<p>Chinese imports, which had been growing in volume since last October, marked a beat in May, to recover slightly in June.</p>
<p>Year to date (June) volumes have increased very significantly, especially for certain products.  WMP imports have risen 29%, while SMP went up 28.4%.  Infant formulae imports were also well up, at 14.6%.  Bulk and packed milk was up a whopping 32%, while cream rose 53% and condensed milk 39%, albeit the last two from much smaller volumes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, demand in Africa and the Middle East continues to struggle. African demand for Jan-June is reported down 10%, although this does not include FFMP (fat filled milk powder or enriched milk powder) which is comfortably offsetting the fall.</p>
<p>Middle eastern demand, after a negative period, is believed to be on the way back up.</p>
<p>Oil price revenues, despite OPEC’s best efforts, have been hampered by crude oil prices remaining around $60/barrell.  For many Middle Eastern and some African countries, these are crucial revenues to finance food, including dairy, imports.</p>
<p>More positively, lower priced butter is now more affordable, and there are reports that this is starting to impact positively on some markets.</p>
<p><strong>Geopolitical uncertainties</strong></p>
<p>These are probably the main factors affecting both the global economic expectations and the market sentiments.</p>
<p>Brexit is the obvious and most immediate one.  Much has been said about the (already being felt) impact of Brexit on beef markets and prices.  But dairy markets, especially Irish dairy exports, are also very dependent on the UK – we have documented this in the initial IFA Brexit document back in March 2017, and <a href=""https://ifalegacystagi.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/763773Brexit-imperatives-policy-paper55629.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">you can check the facts and figures here.</a></p>
<p>Trade disputes between the US and the EU (Airbus v Boeing, and the imposition of import tariffs by the US including on EU dairy products), between the US and China (again, mutual imposition of import tariffs, which have led to serious implications for US farmers, and have given rise to the need for the US to spend a reported $16bn in farmer trade aids) are also causing major disruption in world trade.  The uncertainty this creates for the ability to trade any commodity is damaging all markets, including dairy markets.</p>
<p>Finally, a number of countries with sizeable populations and potential large markets for dairy imports are affected by wars and conflicts – e.g. Iran and much of the rest of the Middle East.</p>

<p><strong>So, what impact on dairy prices?</strong></p>
<p>EU dairy prices are a tale of 2 trends: improving powder prices and easing butter, cheese and whey prices.</p>
<p>Since January, average butter prices as reported by the EU MMO have decreased by €750/tonne, while whey powder has come down €150/t which is 17% to 18% in both cases.</p>
<p>Cheddar cheese prices have been relatively stable, by comparison, with a fall of only €70/t or 2.2%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, WMP is now €140/t higher than it was in early January – that is 5.2% higher; and SMP prices have gone up €340/t, a spectacular increase of 19.5%.</p>

Supply growth remains subdued, but nervous sentiments impacts prices
It’s a bit of a broken record among dairy market analysts: milk output growth globally has remained very subdued – which should underpin better dairy prices –  yet markets are sluggish with easier butter prices the main characteristic.
Global milk production is actually down, estimated at -0.4% for Jan to June, with weak supplies in the US,  Australia and South America.  The new 2019/2020 NZ season looks set for a strong start, with June supplies up around 13% in milk solids terms.  However, June is the trough month, and in 2018 accounted for less than 1% of milk solids production for the full year.
EU production is only very modestly up (only +0.4% for Jan-June), but hides differing trends.  Hence, France’s negative production trend remains negative, but less so, while German production, rising in the first quarter, has been falling every month since.  Dutch milk output continues down (-2.7%) as last year’s herd reduction scheme continues to impact.  Between them, these 3 countries account for around 45% of all EU milk production.
Other countries expanded production, not least Ireland, +10% for the Jan to June period, the UK (+3%) and while Poland had been growing its production fast up till now, it has just registered it first negative since late 2016 in June, down 0.5% compared to the same month last year.
The main problem comes from demand-side factors.
Weaker economic growth
Global economic growth has been easing for some months now, with particular reports from the Eurozone, the US and China.  The IMF has for some time been flagging its concerns about a possible global recession, urging the US and China to resolve their trade skirmishes, and have now reduced their growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020.













Source: USDEC












Global dairy demand is a mixed bag
In simple terms, demand is more buoyant in (some) developing countries than in the developed world.  Hence, demand is relatively sluggish in the EU, while it is reported strong to very strong in Asia (including China).
Chinese imports, which had been growing in volume since last October, marked a beat in May, to recover slightly in June.
Year to date (June) volumes have increased very significantly, especially for certain products.  WMP imports have risen 29%, while SMP went up 28.4%.  Infant formulae imports were also well up, at 14.6%.  Bulk and packed milk was up a whopping 32%, while cream rose 53% and condensed milk 39%, albeit the last two from much smaller volumes.













Source: CLAL.it












On the other hand, demand in Africa and the Middle East continues to struggle. African demand for Jan-June is reported down 10%, although this does not include FFMP (fat filled milk powder or enriched milk powder) which is comfortably offsetting the fall.
Middle eastern demand, after a negative period, is believed to be on the way back up.
Oil price revenues, despite OPEC’s best efforts, have been hampered by crude oil prices remaining around $60/barrell.  For many Middle Eastern and some African countries, these are crucial revenues to finance food, including dairy, imports.
More positively, lower priced butter is now more affordable, and there are reports that this is starting to impact positively on some markets.
Geopolitical uncertainties
These are probably the main factors affecting both the global economic expectations and the market sentiments.
Brexit is the obvious and most immediate one.  Much has been said about the (already being felt) impact of Brexit on beef markets and prices.  But dairy markets, especially Irish dairy exports, are also very dependent on the UK – we have documented this in the initial IFA Brexit document back in March 2017, and you can check the facts and figures here.
Trade disputes between the US and the EU (Airbus v Boeing, and the imposition of import tariffs by the US including on EU dairy products), between the US and China (again, mutual imposition of import tariffs, which have led to serious implications for US farmers, and have given rise to the need for the US to spend a reported $16bn in farmer trade aids) are also causing major disruption in world trade.  The uncertainty this creates for the ability to trade any commodity is damaging all markets, including dairy markets.
Finally, a number of countries with sizeable populations and potential large markets for dairy imports are affected by wars and conflicts – e.g. Iran and much of the rest of the Middle East.












So, what impact on dairy prices?
EU dairy prices are a tale of 2 trends: improving powder prices and easing butter, cheese and whey prices.
Since January, average butter prices as reported by the EU MMO have decreased by €750/tonne, while whey powder has come down €150/t which is 17% to 18% in both cases.
Cheddar cheese prices have been relatively stable, by comparison, with a fall of only €70/t or 2.2%.
Meanwhile, WMP is now €140/t higher than it was in early January – that is 5.2% higher; and SMP prices have gone up €340/t, a spectacular increase of 19.5%.













Based on EU MMO data












GDT trends over the same period have been similar for powders, with a steady, if greater (WMP) and lower (SMP) price improvement than EU quotes have shown.  Whole milk powder (WMP) remains the product the most traded through GDT, as has been the trend from the very beginning.
Butter prices are not dramatically changed from early this year ($50 less per tonne), but this is after a major uplift from March to June.













Based on GDT data












Returns continue to ease – but remain above Irish milk prices!
Returns from dairy product are measured through a number of indicators.
Most directly relevant to Irish co-ops, because it reflects what they trade through Ornua, is the Ornua Product Purchasing Index (PPI).
Just like Irish milk prices, the Ornua PPI is announced in retrospect, and reflects returns for a basket of product traded the month prior to its publication.
For July trade, the Ornua PPI fell by 1.7 points to 104 points.  This was calculated by Ornua to be equivalent to a milk price of 29.31c/l + VAT (30.9c/l incl. VAT).  This is 1.4c/l more than Glanbia are paying for July milk, at 29.5c/l incl VAT.  As we have shown in previous blogs, only the West Cork co-ops have consistently exceeded the Ornua PPI returns in their milk prices over the last 10 months.  The other payers have undershot the PPI for the majority of the last 10 months, with Lakeland Dairies coming closest to it.  In July, though, it appears the gap has widened further: with the exception of Lakeland, who cut by ½ a cent, all other milk purchasers have cut their price by 1c/l, when the PPI equivalent only fell by 0.67c/l.
Other indicators (see table right) have continued to ease, but remain equivalent to milk prices before VAT of between 29c/l and 31c/l (30.6 to 32.7c/l incl VAT).
It would seem most Irish co-ops who wish to sustain their suppliers precious confidence have scope to hold prices for another while!

<p>Speaking from the Virginia Dairy Show in Cavan today, IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan said farmers felt let down that their co-ops’ Brexit preparation strategy seemed to rely pretty heavily on cutting and further talking down milk prices, using farmers’ hard work in terms of increased butterfat and protein content and extra volumes to ‘soften’ the blow.</p>
<p>“With the exception of the West Cork Co-ops, which exceeded it, all other co-ops have paid less than the Ornua Product Purchasing Index for the majority of the last 10 months.  In fact, those co-ops have even widened the gap into July, with the main purchasers cutting their milk prices to levels over 1c/l lower than the Ornua PPI would have returned for the month.  Here in Virginia, I want to acknowledge that Lakeland Dairies have come closest to the PPI over this period,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“While we recognise that butter market prices have eased, powder prices have picked up on EU markets and in the case of WMP at yesterday’s GDT auction.  Latest European average and spot quotes suggest returns for an Irish product mix equivalent to a milk price of around 31c/l incl VAT –1.5c/l more than some of the larger Irish co-ops are paying,” he said.</p>
<p>“Today, in Virginia, where we celebrate the excellence and sustainability of Irish dairy farming, I call on co-ops to communicate how they will at least hold milk price levels to year end.  This is essential to protect the farmer confidence which is such an important ingredient in the sustainability of the Irish dairy success, and co-ops must not undermine that confidence,” he concluded.</p>

<p>IFA Inputs Project Team Leader John Coughlan said compound feed prices are out of line with ingredient costs.  He called on the industry to reduce ration prices immediately given the perilous state of the beef finishing sector.</p>
<p>John Coughlan said, “Many compound feed mills are not reflecting the significant reduction in cereal prices, which unfortunately for tillage farmers are back by as much as €50/t. The failure by the mills to pass through the significant reduction in cereal costs Is indicative of a major swing by compound feed manufacturers, over recent years, away from the use of native cereals to imported maize and by products. Such a move is potentially undermining the provenance of Irish food production at a time when there is an increased focus on the carbon footprint.”</p>
<p>“The feed sector has a duty to maximise native cereals. It has been shown time after time that livestock rations that include a high level of quality native Irish cereals consistently outperform many compound feed rations based on least cost formulations, which invariably use high levels of imported by-products. Irish cereal production not only has an extremely low carbon footprint, but also enhances biodiversity when compared to imported feed ingredients.”</p>

<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman, Tom Phelan said the July PPI reduction of 0.7 points announced today by Ornua, which is equivalent to a milk price of 30.9c/l including VAT, still leaves room for the majority of co-ops to hold their July milk price, at the very worst.</p>
<p>“Apart from the West Cork co-ops, all milk purchasing co-ops have undershot the Ornua PPI in the milk price they have returned to farmers for most of the last eight months,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“Despite the fact that Irish supply is up by 10%, global milk supplies for the first half of the year are down; Germany (-1.5% on May and -1.4% in June), France (-1.6% in May and – 0.2% in June) and Dutch milk output, still moderated by herd reduction, is down 2.7% for the January to May period.

<p>Thomas Cooney, IFA Environment Chairman has rejected Green Party calls for less of Ireland’s sustainable dairy and beef produce, as a solution to the climate challenge.</p>
<p>He said, “The Green Party’s continuous attack on our national herd lacks climate credibility. Farmers in Ireland have a proud climate record, with the European Union’s Joint Research Centre confirming that our dairy farmers are number one and our beef farmers are in the top five when it comes to climate friendly food production. This is important, as the UN IPCC’s report published today (Thursday) recognises that “there is a need to produce about 50% more food by 2050 in order to feed the increasing world population.” The report also highlights that this will lead to “significant increases in GHG emissions” driven by a 6-21% increase in the area of land cleared for cropland.</p>
<p>Cheap shots at Ireland’s dairy and beef farmers demonstrates ignorance of the fact, that demand for protein rich foods produced in Ireland will increase. Therefore, climate advocates have two choices: either back Ireland’s grass-based, carbon friendly model of food production, or support the on-going clear-felling of the Amazonian and other forested regions to create new croplands to meet the increase demand for food.”</p>
<p>Thomas Cooney has expressed his frustration at the Green Party’s failure to back IFA’s calls for a fairer farmers’ share of the retail price of their produce.  “The Green Party has not supported IFA’s call for a ban on below cost selling of farm produce. It has also failed to support the introduction of a retail ombudsman who would bring transparency to the profiteering and sharp practices in the food supply chain, which leave farmers getting 20% of the retail price of food they produce.</p>
<p>It’s time our politicians started to respect the premium product Irish farmers produce and introduce legislation, which ends profiteering of others in the food chain.”</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy has called on Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys and Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed to move immediately to make changes to the pilot employment permit scheme which will address the rapidly worsening labour and skills shortages for dairy, horticulture, pigs and poultry farms.</p>
<p><span id=""more-19988""></span></p>
<p>“We have already made strong and detailed business cases for this in the last six weeks in sector-specific submissions to the Departments of Agriculture and Enterprise.  Farmers need 200 extra permits for dairy, 125 for pigs/poultry and some amendments to ensure the scheme is fit for purpose for the various sectors, including the highly seasonal demands of horticulture,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“IFA submits to the review for the recruitment of workers from outside the EU/EEA twice a year, every year.  Though the country is now at full employment, farm workers continue to be considered ineligible in the system,” Mr Healy said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“After strong evidence was put forward by the sector’s stakeholders of the rapidly worsening challenges of recruiting within the Irish and EU/EEA labour markets, Minister Humphreys recognised the validity of our arguments and in June last year opened a pilot scheme to make available 50 dairy assistant and 500 horticulture worker permits.  The pig and poultry farming sectors, inexplicably, were left out, while the meat processing sector was initially allocated 250 permits, now increased to 1,500, with more to come,” he added.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“All 50 dairy assistant permits have now been taken up, and a number of dairy farm employers have applications in the system based on identified workers who simply won’t wait around.  More prospective dairy farm employers would also apply to secure their labour needs well ahead of next spring’s busiest season.  Poultry and pig farmers, whose sectors are expanding reflecting increased domestic consumption and market opportunities in China, need to be able to avail of their own quota of permits.  Finally, farm employers in the horticulture sector need amendments to the scheme for it to better fit their particular, highly seasonal mix of skilled and unskilled positions,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ministers Humphreys and Creed showed their understanding of agriculture’s labour shortages when the pilot scheme was introduced last year.  They must now show greater urgency in delivering the additional work permits that farmers are crying out for,” he concluded.</p>

<h4><strong>Global dairy output is down, intervention stocks empty – so why aren’t we seeing more market optimism?</strong></h4>
<p>2019 global milk supplies to May were estimated down 0.3% (down 0.4% for May itself), with US production static, New Zealand down as the season comes to a close, Australian supplies sharply reduced, Argentinian output well back, and only EU production up very modestly.</p>
<p><span id=""more-19975""></span></p>
<p>The forecast for the rest of 2019 (see graph below) is for a switch from mid-year to a trend slightly above 2018, with a stronger recovery as we move to year-end trough.</p>

<p><em>Source: Ornua</em></p>
<p>Private butter stocks have been reported as higher than normal, but intervention stocks of SMP are now empty, with the last 162t sold on 18<sup>th</sup> June for a minimum price of €1759/t.  This is a total of over 405,000t of SMP now gone out of intervention and most likely by now fully absorbed by the market.</p>
<p>So why are dairy prices and market sentiment gloomy, and is the pessimism justified?</p>
<p><strong>Is demand depressed?</strong></p>
<p>With supplies subdued in almost all production regions, it is logical to consider whether depressed demand is what affects market sentiment.</p>
<p>Recent high butter prices were always difficult to sustain when they were difficult to recoup from the retail or food services chain.  But those have fallen back from up to €7000/t in 2017 to just under €4000/t.  And these lower prices appear to start to have an impact: while EU retail demand for butter had been sluggish, there are now reports of retail demand recovering.</p>
<p>This is a quick round up of the state of demand in the main regions, courtesy of Ornua:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Demand is reasonably good in the following regions:</em></li>
<li>North America (US) have seen weaker exports (reflecting weaker milk output), but domestic consumption of butter and cheese in particular is on the up, with SMP consumption also rising.</li>
<li>North Asia, including China, saw a significant increase in imports, by 13%. This was majorly influenced by China’s increased imports of powders and liquid milk.  The African Swine Fever impact on the pig herd, however, has reduced significantly the imports of whey for pig feed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>In South East Asia, import demand was up strongly a +11%, but the rate of growth has eased somewhat since. Powder and soft cheese imports have been strong, while butter, hard cheese and whey were weaker.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Demand is muted to stable in the following regions:</em>
<ul>
<li>EU domestic demand is muted for cheese and butter, though as previously stated there is some response from retail sales due to lower butter prices. Whole milk powder use remains solid, though SMP consumption is weaker.</li>
<li>South America (see more re. Mercosur below) started the year strongly with imports, and while demand eased somewhat for WMP, whey and SMP in March and April, cheese and casein demand has remained strong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Demand is somewhat problematic in the following regions:</em>
<ul>
<li>Total African imports are down 5%, though this does not include enriched milk powders, (fat filled milk powders) which are offsetting somewhat the lower SMP and WMP sales. Also, cheese demand does continue to rise.</li>
<li>Middle Eastern demand for WMP is poor, though SMP and butter imports are growing somewhat. There are signs of import improvements for most dairy products.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the factors impacting demand?</strong></p>
<p>Global economic growth is forecast to fall this year, because of economic weaknesses in developed countries and in China.  China is currently recording the slowest economic growth rate in 27 years, at 6.2%.  It was telling, last month, that IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde was urging the US and China to sort out their differences to reduce the risk of a global economic downturn.</p>
<p>Despite a recent decision by OPEC to reduce crude oil supplies, prices remain around US$65/barrel, again kept down by concerns around global economic growth.</p>
<p>The € is stronger against both the US $ and Sterling (Brexit uncertainty), affecting the competitiveness of EU exports.</p>
<p>Traded volumes have been generally strong in the first two quarters of the year, but there is a view that this will slow down in the second half because of trade wars and the build-up of (private) stocks.  Such stock build-up has been caused in the UK by the preparation for 2 Brexit deadline (the next on 31<sup>st</sup> Oct, and the risk of a no-deal deemed to be greater, stock build up will not be resolved in the short term).</p>
<p>The main drivers of this strong first half demand were developing countries, and it is good to see that demand in developed countries (EU and US) is improving.</p>
<p>So, while most reports do not suggest very strong growth in demand at this point, they do not suggest that there is a major demand downturn.</p>
<p>It seems that markets are nervous because of international economic and geopolitical factors that have yet to impact (Brexit, US erratic trade policy and an expected lower growth in the Chinese economy all come into this).</p>
<p><strong>Dairy returns comfortably underpin current milk prices – June Ornua PPI is 1c/l above most co-ops’ milk prices</strong></p>
<p>Average EU dairy prices as recorded by the EU Milk Market Observatory for 7<sup>th</sup> July showed very slight price improvements for butter, SMP and WMP.  During June, only very slightly easier gross returns compared to May were mostly in excess of a gross 35.5c/l before processing costs.</p>
<p>Overall, the notional Irish product mix, after deduction of 5c/l for processing costs, would return a farm gate milk price equivalent of 30.36c/l + VAT (32c/l incl VAT).   This represents a very slight easing of under 0.5c/l during the month.</p>

<p><em>Based on EU MMO data</em></p>
<p>Other indicators have also eased a little, as is shown in our usual table keeping tabs on the main international and national (Ornua PPI) indicators.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Ornua PPI, it has eased by 1.6 points for June trade, down to 105.7, equivalent to a milk price of 29.98c/l + VAT (31.62c/l incl VAT) – which remains 1c/l more than what our main milk purchasing co-ops are paying for June milk.</p>

<p>IFA has tracked the milk price paid by the main Irish co-ops, using the Farmers’ Journal monthly milk league, and compared those with the evolution of the Ornua PPI milk price equivalent over the last 9 months.  With the exception of the West Cork co-ops, the other co-ops have paid less than the PPI for the majority of those 9 months.</p>
<p>Note: while as we write the June Milk League has yet to be published in the Farmers’ Journal, all those co-ops that have announced their price have held at May levels.</p>

<p><strong>Mercosur and dairy: extra volumes at lower tariffs</strong></p>
<p>The dairy concessions under the EU-Mercosur deal are bilateral.  Each party will be given the same opportunity to export to each-other’s market tariff free, after a transitional period of 10 years – i.e. within quota tariffs will be lowered by 10 % p.a. from their current levels.  Dairy import tariffs average out at around 28% of the EU price for the product currently.</p>
<p>The volumes concerned are 30,000t cheese, 10,000t milk powders and 5,000t infant formula.  There has been no further details as to what type of cheese, or as to the divvying out of the export opportunities between countries in either group.</p>
<p>This is not in the IDELE document, but it is worth noting that there has been no import of SMP, butter, cheese, WMP or whey powder from the Mercosur countries into the EU in the last number of years.</p>
<p>Exports from the EU to the Mercosur country are tiny, with only 900t of whey powder and 100 t of WMP exported to Brazil in 2018 (and this reflects a normal enough historical trade pattern).</p>
<p><strong>Validation of the agreement</strong></p>
<p>The Mercosur/EU trade deal is expected to be, similar to the Japan agreement, a simple trade deal which does not require individual member states’ approval.  For implementation, it must be adopted by the EU Parliament (blocking minority is 35%) and Council (qualified majority = 55% of MS representing 65% of the population).</p>
<p>There remains many technical details to be sorted, as well as evaluation work before any votes in Parliament and Council, and this could take around 2 years before ratification and implementation actually begins.</p>
<p>So any impact from Mercosur, good or bad, will be some years down the line relative to a Brexit outcome!</p>
<p>Note: while the above on the validation of the agreement reflects the IDELE analysis (and the presentation of the Deal by the EU Commission), some hold the view that the deal is not a simple trade deal, because it includes intellectual property considerations (protection of Geographic Indication for up to 350 products, for example).  Should this be the case, there may be a legal argument that the deal does indeed require approval by individual member states, which would give every member state an effective veto.  Watch this space!</p>

Global dairy output is down, intervention stocks empty – so why aren’t we seeing more market optimism?
2019 global milk supplies to May were estimated down 0.3% (down 0.4% for May itself), with US production static, New Zealand down as the season comes to a close, Australian supplies sharply reduced, Argentinian output well back, and only EU production up very modestly.

The forecast for the rest of 2019 (see graph below) is for a switch from mid-year to a trend slightly above 2018, with a stronger recovery as we move to year-end trough.

Source: Ornua
Private butter stocks have been reported as higher than normal, but intervention stocks of SMP are now empty, with the last 162t sold on 18th June for a minimum price of €1759/t.  This is a total of over 405,000t of SMP now gone out of intervention and most likely by now fully absorbed by the market.
So why are dairy prices and market sentiment gloomy, and is the pessimism justified?
Is demand depressed?
With supplies subdued in almost all production regions, it is logical to consider whether depressed demand is what affects market sentiment.
Recent high butter prices were always difficult to sustain when they were difficult to recoup from the retail or food services chain.  But those have fallen back from up to €7000/t in 2017 to just under €4000/t.  And these lower prices appear to start to have an impact: while EU retail demand for butter had been sluggish, there are now reports of retail demand recovering.
This is a quick round up of the state of demand in the main regions, courtesy of Ornua:

Demand is reasonably good in the following regions:
North America (US) have seen weaker exports (reflecting weaker milk output), but domestic consumption of butter and cheese in particular is on the up, with SMP consumption also rising.
North Asia, including China, saw a significant increase in imports, by 13%. This was majorly influenced by China’s increased imports of powders and liquid milk.  The African Swine Fever impact on the pig herd, however, has reduced significantly the imports of whey for pig feed.

In South East Asia, import demand was up strongly a +11%, but the rate of growth has eased somewhat since. Powder and soft cheese imports have been strong, while butter, hard cheese and whey were weaker.


Demand is muted to stable in the following regions:

EU domestic demand is muted for cheese and butter, though as previously stated there is some response from retail sales due to lower butter prices. Whole milk powder use remains solid, though SMP consumption is weaker.
South America (see more re. Mercosur below) started the year strongly with imports, and while demand eased somewhat for WMP, whey and SMP in March and April, cheese and casein demand has remained strong.


Demand is somewhat problematic in the following regions:

Total African imports are down 5%, though this does not include enriched milk powders, (fat filled milk powders) which are offsetting somewhat the lower SMP and WMP sales. Also, cheese demand does continue to rise.
Middle Eastern demand for WMP is poor, though SMP and butter imports are growing somewhat. There are signs of import improvements for most dairy products.



What are the factors impacting demand?
Global economic growth is forecast to fall this year, because of economic weaknesses in developed countries and in China.  China is currently recording the slowest economic growth rate in 27 years, at 6.2%.  It was telling, last month, that IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde was urging the US and China to sort out their differences to reduce the risk of a global economic downturn.
Despite a recent decision by OPEC to reduce crude oil supplies, prices remain around US$65/barrel, again kept down by concerns around global economic growth.
The € is stronger against both the US $ and Sterling (Brexit uncertainty), affecting the competitiveness of EU exports.
Traded volumes have been generally strong in the first two quarters of the year, but there is a view that this will slow down in the second half because of trade wars and the build-up of (private) stocks.  Such stock build-up has been caused in the UK by the preparation for 2 Brexit deadline (the next on 31st Oct, and the risk of a no-deal deemed to be greater, stock build up will not be resolved in the short term).
The main drivers of this strong first half demand were developing countries, and it is good to see that demand in developed countries (EU and US) is improving.
So, while most reports do not suggest very strong growth in demand at this point, they do not suggest that there is a major demand downturn.
It seems that markets are nervous because of international economic and geopolitical factors that have yet to impact (Brexit, US erratic trade policy and an expected lower growth in the Chinese economy all come into this).
Dairy returns comfortably underpin current milk prices – June Ornua PPI is 1c/l above most co-ops’ milk prices
Average EU dairy prices as recorded by the EU Milk Market Observatory for 7th July showed very slight price improvements for butter, SMP and WMP.  During June, only very slightly easier gross returns compared to May were mostly in excess of a gross 35.5c/l before processing costs.
Overall, the notional Irish product mix, after deduction of 5c/l for processing costs, would return a farm gate milk price equivalent of 30.36c/l + VAT (32c/l incl VAT).   This represents a very slight easing of under 0.5c/l during the month.

Based on EU MMO data
Other indicators have also eased a little, as is shown in our usual table keeping tabs on the main international and national (Ornua PPI) indicators.
Speaking of the Ornua PPI, it has eased by 1.6 points for June trade, down to 105.7, equivalent to a milk price of 29.98c/l + VAT (31.62c/l incl VAT) – which remains 1c/l more than what our main milk purchasing co-ops are paying for June milk.

IFA has tracked the milk price paid by the main Irish co-ops, using the Farmers’ Journal monthly milk league, and compared those with the evolution of the Ornua PPI milk price equivalent over the last 9 months.  With the exception of the West Cork co-ops, the other co-ops have paid less than the PPI for the majority of those 9 months.
Note: while as we write the June Milk League has yet to be published in the Farmers’ Journal, all those co-ops that have announced their price have held at May levels.







Based on Farmers’ Journal’s monthly milk price league and Ornua PPI milk price equivalent
Strong support was provided by co-ops for farmers in 2018, in the form of milk price top ups, merchant credit and other rebates, and even fodder/feed imports.  These were as appreciated as they were needed.
However, it is clear that co-ops have not passed back the full of the market returns this year so far, banking on the impact on milk cheques of additional volumes and improved constituents to rebuild balance sheets.  They are also voicing much of the cautious sentiment highlighted above to create negative expectations for the next number of months, when the negative market factors have yet to materialise.
And finally: the EU/Mercosur Deal and Dairy – (Analysis courtesy of IDELE (French Livestock Institute)).
There has been much commentary and press coverage about how the Mercosur deal is bad news for beef farmers.  But there have also been suggestions that it was a far more positive story for dairy.  Is that so?
French agri-economists at l’Institut de l’Elevage (IDELE), the French Livestock Institute, have published an interesting analysis, the dairy aspect of which is translated and summed up below.  By all accounts, the dairy story is less negative, but nor does it provide spectacular enough opportunities to make up for the likely impact on beef.
Definite potential for Argentina and Uruguay
Argentina and Uruguay are 6th and 7th world exporters of dairy products (1.8 and 1.7m tonnes of milk equivalent respectively).  Output has been growing in Uruguay, and there has been a recovery in Argentinian production after 2 years of crisis. Argentina trades mostly with Brazil, while Uruguay currently ships to Algeria, Russia and China.

Argentina’s milk price is far lower than that of the other exporters, and made even more competitive by the devaluation of the local currency.
It is therefore clear that Argentina in particular would have a competitive advantage, starting, just like for beef, with a significantly lower raw material price (milk).

However, the EU has equivalent opportunities to export more into Mercosur countries (the quotas agreed are reciprocal).
The same concerns arise regarding differences in standards as are relevant to beef.
Mercosur and dairy: extra volumes at lower tariffs
The dairy concessions under the EU-Mercosur deal are bilateral.  Each party will be given the same opportunity to export to each-other’s market tariff free, after a transitional period of 10 years – i.e. within quota tariffs will be lowered by 10 % p.a. from their current levels.  Dairy import tariffs average out at around 28% of the EU price for the product currently.
The volumes concerned are 30,000t cheese, 10,000t milk powders and 5,000t infant formula.  There has been no further details as to what type of cheese, or as to the divvying out of the export opportunities between countries in either group.
This is not in the IDELE document, but it is worth noting that there has been no import of SMP, butter, cheese, WMP or whey powder from the Mercosur countries into the EU in the last number of years.
Exports from the EU to the Mercosur country are tiny, with only 900t of whey powder and 100 t of WMP exported to Brazil in 2018 (and this reflects a normal enough historical trade pattern).
Validation of the agreement
The Mercosur/EU trade deal is expected to be, similar to the Japan agreement, a simple trade deal which does not require individual member states’ approval.  For implementation, it must be adopted by the EU Parliament (blocking minority is 35%) and Council (qualified majority = 55% of MS representing 65% of the population).
There remains many technical details to be sorted, as well as evaluation work before any votes in Parliament and Council, and this could take around 2 years before ratification and implementation actually begins.
So any impact from Mercosur, good or bad, will be some years down the line relative to a Brexit outcome!
Note: while the above on the validation of the agreement reflects the IDELE analysis (and the presentation of the Deal by the EU Commission), some hold the view that the deal is not a simple trade deal, because it includes intellectual property considerations (protection of Geographic Indication for up to 350 products, for example).  Should this be the case, there may be a legal argument that the deal does indeed require approval by individual member states, which would give every member state an effective veto.  Watch this space!

<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan said the June PPI reduction of 1.6 points announced today by Ornua, which is equivalent to a milk price of 29.98c/l before VAT (31.6c/l incl VAT), still leaves room for the majority of co-ops to increase their June milk price by 1c/l.</p>

<p>“Apart from the West Cork Co-ops, all milk purchasing co-ops have undershot the Ornua PPI in the milk price they have returned to farmers for most of the last seven months,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“Global milk supplies are not growing at the moment, and are falling dramatically in some of the main regions, such as New Zealand, the US, Australia and Argentina.  Also, intervention stocks of SMP are now totally empty,” he said.</p>
<p>“Demand is relatively good in Asia, South America, the EU and the US,” he added.</p>

https://www.ifa.ie/farm-sectors/milk-price-increase-overdue-for-june/,Milk Price Increase Overdue for June,2 July 2019,"<div class=""single-content"">
<p>FA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan today pointed out that, as well as paying up to 1.5c/l less than the May Ornua PPI, and undershooting it for the last 6 months at least, Ireland’s main milk purchasing co-ops had underperformed massively in the Dutch LTO European milk league in the last 12 months.  LTO tracks the price paid by a selection of milk purchasers in the main EU dairy production countries.  For Ireland, it tracks Dairygold, Kerry and Glanbia.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is clear that Irish co-ops have been doing a much poorer job at remunerating their suppliers than the European private and co-operative milk purchasers tracked each month by Dutch farm organisation LTO in their Milk Price Review. The main 3 Irish processors are currently paying €2.25 less per 100 kgs of milk than the average monthly price reported by LTO.  This is equivalent to just under 2c/l at 3.3% protein and 3.6% butterfat, and as the graph overleaf shows, the gap has widened dramatically in the last 12 months,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“In a couple of weeks’ time, co-op boards will start to consider their June milk prices.  It is widely expected that volumes will have continued to grow significantly.  Board members cannot depend on their fellow-farmers’ hard work to produce extra constituents and volumes and short-change them this month again on milk prices,” he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>“At just under 29c/l + VAT, the main Irish co-ops currently pay up to 1.5c/l less than the May Ornua PPI of 30.45c/l + VAT (32.09c/l incl VAT).  The gap has increased in the last two months as the PPI rose and co-ops cut prices.  The Ornua PPI is most likely to at least hold into June.  Farmers need that extra 1.5c/l to pay the massive bills they accumulated during 2018 – every bit of peak milk income must be available to deal with those debts, many of which are with the co-ops’ own agri supply divisions,” he concluded.</p>

<p>Speaking only days before the first co-ops decide their May milk prices, IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan today (Monday) said that a price increase of at least 1c/l was justified in most cases, especially for those co-ops which have been paying less than the Ornua PPI equivalent for the last few months.</p>
<p>“All indicators we have been monitoring for the last couple of months have returned more than the main Irish co-ops have been paying.  The May Ornua PPI, which tracks the products and prices traded for the month in question and is therefore very representative of Irish co-ops’ activity, at 30.45c/l + VAT, is only matched or bettered by the 4 West Cork Co-ops.  Since April, with co-ops cutting prices and the Ornua PPI increasing by 1.4 points, the gap between co-op payouts and the Ornua index has in fact widened,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“Beyond the Ornua PPI, the EU MMO for early June would return an Irish milk price equivalent of 30.81c/l + VAT (32.47c/l incl VAT) after deduction of a notional processing cost of 5c/l.  Average EU spot quotes for butter and SMP on 5<sup>th</sup> June would have returned a milk price equivalent of 32.02c/l + VAT (33.73c/l incl VAT) using the same processing cost,” he said.</p>
<p>“A drought induced downturn in New Zealand output (-8.4% for April) could influence early 2019/20 production and help maintain the supply/demand balance to sustain higher dairy prices,” he added.</p>
<p>“It is clear that Irish co-ops are being overly cautious, and are denying farmers the real current market returns, making them pay for potential impact from Brexit which have yet to materialise.  Meanwhile, markets are returning more than they are paying back to farmers – this is unfair, when this is the time dairy farmers generate the bulk of their income, and paying back last year’s massively increased bills is taking every available cent,” he said.</p>
<p>“There is clear scope for co-ops to increase the price they pay to farmers, in most cases by at least 1c/l for May milk.  I urge co-op board members, when they sit down to decide in the next few days, to see to it that this is passed back to their fellow dairy farmers,” he concluded.</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy has welcomed the intervention by EU Commissioner Phil Hogan in the escalating fertiliser debacle that has seen the recent imposition of temporary anti-dumping duties on certain non-EU UAN fertiliser imports by DG Trade.</p>
<p>Mr Healy said, “Commissioner Hogan’s request of Competition Commissioner Vestager to take swift action to ensure the proper functioning of the EU’s internal fertiliser market, in light of questionable business practices with respect to competition rules, represents a key turning point in this case”.</p>
<p>“Commissioner Hogan’s assessment of the malfunctioning of the EU’s fertiliser market mirrors many of the conclusions raised in the IFA commissioned study into the sector, carried out by the Washington based International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). Indeed, he rightly points to the need for price transparency and the operation of fair pricing mechanisms to create a properly functioning market.”</p>
<p>“The IFPRI report, published in 2016, found that EU farmers are paying among the highest prices in the world for mineral fertilisers. Anti-dumping duties and customs tariffs imposed by the EU Commission on certain non-EU fertiliser imports were costing farmers €1 billion per annum. It established that the increased concentration of EU industry since 1994 enabled fertiliser producers to significantly increase profit margins. Indeed, DG Trade, in its recent interim expiry review of ammonium nitrate anti-dumping duties concurred with the IFPRI findings regarding increased concentration of the industry.”</p>
<p>“More alarmingly the IFPRI report identified that EU fertiliser prices not in line with the predicted model outcome. It stated that <em>“Based on the observed data, prices in Western European countries actually increased by 123%, while prices in Brazil decreased by 65% . . . . .  further suggests that additional factors, <strong>such as price fixing and cartels, </strong>might be operating in highly concentrated markets such as Western Europe”.</em></p>
<p>“In light of these findings it is all the more worrying that DG Trade saw fit to extend temporary anti-dumping (AD) duties recently to certain UAN fertiliser imports. This is despite the fact that IFA, COPA and other EU farming groups highlighted that the additional duties will cost farmers an estimated €2.7bn over the term, thus disproportionately affecting farm incomes which are already at an all-time low across many sectors.”</p>

<p>The average EU MMO prices for week ending 5<sup>th</sup> May saw increases in milk powder prices, and a slight settling of butter, cheese and whey powder.  The upshot is that the returns for the notional Irish product mix in the table right is 36c/l before the deduction of processing costs.  Assuming our usual notional 5c/l, this would be equivalent to 31c/l + VAT or 32.67c/l incl VAT.  Again, 1 or 2 c/l above what the main milk purchasers payed for milk in March.</p>

<p>EU Spot prices have shown a recent resumption of SMP price increases, perhaps suggesting that SMP stocks sold out of intervention have by now mostly been absorbed in the market place.  Latest EU spots showed SMP breaking the €2000/t barrier, at €2023.  Butter prices are settling around €4150-4200 for the moment, with whey powder slightly weaker.</p>

<p>As to current expectation of September 2019 prices from the EU futures markets (EEX), they predict a butter price of around €4370/t – slightly less than recent weeks’ expectations – but a SMP price of around €2,200, slightly up on previous results, and 10% above current spot market quotations.</p>
<p>The table below shows that the combination of those futures prices would yield a notional price of just over 34c/l + VAT.</p>

<p><strong>What underpins the stronger prices?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve seen for a number of months now that global milk output has grown by a lot less than expected, and crucially at a lesser pace than demand is growing.</p>
<p>Supplies of milk in the 7 most important export regions (EU, US, New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay), as reported by Rabobank in its Q1 2019 Dairy Quarterly Report, grew by a mere 0.1% for the first quarter.</p>
<p>The main reasons have been weather – drought and other inclement events –  and price related – producer prices have been falling in the last year, and no longer cover costs in many regions.</p>
<p>For the EU, Rabobank expect milk supplies to only start picking up in the second half of the year – which will be well past peak.</p>

<p>In the US, supplies are challenged also by economics, and prospects are poorer due to international trade challenges, especially caused by the Trump administration’s approach to trade with China.</p>
<p>New Zealand March milk supplies fell a dramatic 7.5% (9% for Fonterra), with Rabobank predicting lower growth for the rest of the season due to moisture deficit encouraging farmers, especially in the North Island, to dry off earlier.</p>
<p>In South America, production is on the up, but prices are poor, and local demand challenged by difficult economic conditions.</p>
<p>Finally in Australia, production is continuing to fall as margins continue tight despite some improvement in milk prices.</p>
<p>In China, imports have continued strong, with double digit growth expected for all of the first half, possibly more moderate in the second half.  Disease has cut back significantly pork production, which is both good and bad from a dairy consumption perspective: pigs consumer quite a bit of whey, so imports of that commodity will likely decrease.  However, pigmeat being one of the most important sources of protein for Chinese consumers, alternative protein, including dairy, will see an increase in consumption as pigmeat gets scarcer.</p>

<p>The recovery in the supply/demand balance has been further favoured with a rapid disposal of SMP out of intervention stocks. A total of 378,600t were sold since sales began (very, very slowly!!) in December 2016.  Most recently, 33 tonnes were sold on 16<sup>th</sup> April at the maximum offered price of €1660/t, leaving 1106t for sale at the next tender of 21<sup>st</sup> May.  What is left of the stock is held in Spain (510t), the UK (389t) and Slovakia (207t).</p>
<p>For some time, however, the view among commentators was that though the product was being sold out of intervention, it was taking time for it to be absorbed by the market, and therefore it continued to influence and restrict price increases for the fresh product.  It does look now like that effect has come to an end.</p>

<p><strong>So, should we see better Irish milk prices soon?</strong></p>
<p>Logic would suggest that we should.  And this would be particularly important as peak milk production months are now upon us, and those larger milk cheques are critical to every dairy farmer in dealing with the still outstanding bills incurred during 2018.  While many co-ops provided much appreciated support in merchant credit facilities, rebates and even fodder imports when it was so badly needed, those bills must now be paid.  Farmers need every possible cent for the milk they produced last month, and for what they will be producing over the summer.</p>
<p>In the graph below, we compare the prices paid by the main co-ops for March 2019 as recorded in cents per litre in the Farmers’ Journal Milk League, and we compare them with some of the most relevant indicators we have already reviewed.</p>
<p>Some are paying less than the Ornua PPI, and only the West Cork Co-ops are matching (more or less) the current EU spot prices’ returns.</p>

A turn around for the better?
EU powder prices reported by the EU MMO and average spots in the Netherlands, Germany and France have resumed their increase.  SMP spots have now broken the €2000/t barrier, with average EU prices close behind.  Butter prices, on the other hand, are somewhere between stable and slightly easier.  On the international stage, GDT is on its 11th consecutive positive auction.
Is global scarcity impacting prices?  Is intervention SMP finally working its way through the market place, after leaving EU stocks in recent months?  Is the kicking of the Brexit can to next Halloween at least buying us time of normal trading conditions, at best making a crash out Brexit less likely?












Improved prices
One thing for certain: all the indices industry watchers monitor are on the up.
To start at home, the Ornua PPI for April has lifted from 104.1 points for March to 105.9 points.  This is equivalent to a milk price of 30c/l + VAT (31.6c/l incl VAT), an increase of 0.6c/l on the previous month, and a little more than many of the main milk purchasers have been paying for March milk (see graph below).

The average EU MMO prices for week ending 5th May saw increases in milk powder prices, and a slight settling of butter, cheese and whey powder.  The upshot is that the returns for the notional Irish product mix in the table right is 36c/l before the deduction of processing costs.  Assuming our usual notional 5c/l, this would be equivalent to 31c/l + VAT or 32.67c/l incl VAT.  Again, 1 or 2 c/l above what the main milk purchasers payed for milk in March.













Based on EU MMO data












Other indicators have also continued to improve, not least GDT prices, with the auction platform registering last week its 11thconsecutive positive index movement, but also European spots and futures.
The GDT index is now 28.4% up on last November, with the most noticeable element the continued improvement in SMP prices, to a current level of $2521/t.

EU Spot prices have shown a recent resumption of SMP price increases, perhaps suggesting that SMP stocks sold out of intervention have by now mostly been absorbed in the market place.  Latest EU spots showed SMP breaking the €2000/t barrier, at €2023.  Butter prices are settling around €4150-4200 for the moment, with whey powder slightly weaker.

As to current expectation of September 2019 prices from the EU futures markets (EEX), they predict a butter price of around €4370/t – slightly less than recent weeks’ expectations – but a SMP price of around €2,200, slightly up on previous results, and 10% above current spot market quotations.
The table below shows that the combination of those futures prices would yield a notional price of just over 34c/l + VAT.

























What underpins the stronger prices?
We’ve seen for a number of months now that global milk output has grown by a lot less than expected, and crucially at a lesser pace than demand is growing.
Supplies of milk in the 7 most important export regions (EU, US, New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay), as reported by Rabobank in its Q1 2019 Dairy Quarterly Report, grew by a mere 0.1% for the first quarter.
The main reasons have been weather – drought and other inclement events –  and price related – producer prices have been falling in the last year, and no longer cover costs in many regions.
For the EU, Rabobank expect milk supplies to only start picking up in the second half of the year – which will be well past peak.

In the US, supplies are challenged also by economics, and prospects are poorer due to international trade challenges, especially caused by the Trump administration’s approach to trade with China.
New Zealand March milk supplies fell a dramatic 7.5% (9% for Fonterra), with Rabobank predicting lower growth for the rest of the season due to moisture deficit encouraging farmers, especially in the North Island, to dry off earlier.
In South America, production is on the up, but prices are poor, and local demand challenged by difficult economic conditions.
Finally in Australia, production is continuing to fall as margins continue tight despite some improvement in milk prices.
In China, imports have continued strong, with double digit growth expected for all of the first half, possibly more moderate in the second half.  Disease has cut back significantly pork production, which is both good and bad from a dairy consumption perspective: pigs consumer quite a bit of whey, so imports of that commodity will likely decrease.  However, pigmeat being one of the most important sources of protein for Chinese consumers, alternative protein, including dairy, will see an increase in consumption as pigmeat gets scarcer.












The recovery in the supply/demand balance has been further favoured with a rapid disposal of SMP out of intervention stocks. A total of 378,600t were sold since sales began (very, very slowly!!) in December 2016.  Most recently, 33 tonnes were sold on 16th April at the maximum offered price of €1660/t, leaving 1106t for sale at the next tender of 21st May.  What is left of the stock is held in Spain (510t), the UK (389t) and Slovakia (207t).
For some time, however, the view among commentators was that though the product was being sold out of intervention, it was taking time for it to be absorbed by the market, and therefore it continued to influence and restrict price increases for the fresh product.  It does look now like that effect has come to an end.

So, should we see better Irish milk prices soon?
Logic would suggest that we should.  And this would be particularly important as peak milk production months are now upon us, and those larger milk cheques are critical to every dairy farmer in dealing with the still outstanding bills incurred during 2018.  While many co-ops provided much appreciated support in merchant credit facilities, rebates and even fodder imports when it was so badly needed, those bills must now be paid.  Farmers need every possible cent for the milk they produced last month, and for what they will be producing over the summer.
In the graph below, we compare the prices paid by the main co-ops for March 2019 as recorded in cents per litre in the Farmers’ Journal Milk League, and we compare them with some of the most relevant indicators we have already reviewed.
Some are paying less than the Ornua PPI, and only the West Cork Co-ops are matching (more or less) the current EU spot prices’ returns.

<p>Commenting on today’s (Tuesday) decision by Lakeland and Glanbia to hold their milk prices for the milk produced by farmers in April, IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan said it was important that, for the next few months, co-ops would adopt a more positive mindset on milk prices to reflect improved markets and help with the increased cash flow needs of dairy farmers.</p>
<p>“The National Dairy Committee has engaged in a major lobbying exercise for April milk in every co-op area.  It is quite remarkable that, bearing in mind the amount of talking down of milk prices coming from some co-op management teams and boards, the first two co-ops to announce their milk price have decided to hold.  A more positive move would have been to declare the end of cuts, too,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“In light of lower global supplies, stronger Oceanian dairy price trends as shown by last week’s GDT auction, and improved EU and international powder prices, exemplified by the lift in the Ornua PPI milk price equivalent to 31.6c/l incl VAT, co-ops can and must, switch towards a more positive approach on milk prices from now on,” he concluded.</p>

<p><strong>Price stability justified for 2019</strong></p>
<p>With subdued global milk supply growth, empty SMP intervention stores, a Brexit threat delayed well past peak and reasonable demand from China and Asia, all indicators point to stable dairy market prices after some earlier easing – which should spell stable milk prices.  So, why should co-ops at this point commit to no further milk price cuts for 2019?</p>
<p><strong>Supply growth negative in February</strong></p>
<p>Worldwide milk production by the main exporting nations has gone into negative territory in February (see graph below).</p>
<p>This reflects the continued severe downturn in Australian supplies (down 12.6% for February, and by 6.4% for the June to February period).</p>
<p>Also down are EU supplies: for the combined January and February period, they were 0.6% down in volume, with Germany, France and the Netherlands well back.  Exceptions worthy of note are of course Ireland and Poland.</p>
<p>US output was only up 0.2% for February, and growth there, which had been between 1.5% and 2% every month, year on year, has been much more subdued in recent months.</p>
<p>New Zealand had been forging ahead strongly through their October peak.  However, it started the calendar year in reverse, with February supplies down 0.12%, and March supplies well back by 7.4%!</p>
<p>With global output growth stable to negative, markets have taken good note of likely scarcer supplies later this year – which has translated most clearly into 10 consecutive positive GDT auctions, the last one earlier this week.</p>

<p>In their Quarter 1 Dairy Quarterly report, Rabobank do expect that lower output growth will remain the form for much of 2019, and they even go so far as to suggest that low growth might persist into 2020.  The main reason they give for this is the fall in milk prices over recent months to levels in most countries below production costs.</p>
<p>This expectation leads them to forecast stable milk prices for the first 2 quarters of 2019, possibly followed by some price improvements from the end of quarter 2.</p>

<p>A total of 378,504t have been sold out of intervention since the sales began in 2016.  With only just over 1000t left, stocks are quasi empty.  However, it is likely that some of this product has still to be absorbed in the market place.</p>

<p><strong>GDT scores 10 consecutive increases</strong></p>
<p>Since early December 2018, all 10 GDT auctions have scored positive index increases, the latest one on 16<sup>th</sup> April at +0.5%.</p>
<p>The index has increased 28% since late November.  Butter prices, at US $5544/t are almost €800 dearer at current exchange rates than the most recent average EU butter prices.  SMP is almost €300/t dearer than EU product prices.  As a result, the latest SMP and butter prices would yield an “Irish” milk price of 36.32c/l + VAT.</p>

<p><strong>EU powder prices stable to firmer since January</strong></p>
<p>There has been a divergence between price trends in GDT and global international markets, which have seen strong growth in butter and powder prices, and EU prices.</p>
<p>EU butter prices have been slipping early this year, yet remain above €4000/t, and so at historically high levels.  Whey powder prices have also been slipping somewhat.</p>
<p>However, SMP and WMP has both been firming since January, reflecting strong exports and the emptying of intervention stocks.</p>

<p>Based on EU MMO</p>
<p><strong>Brexit threat postponed, but…</strong></p>
<p>After two deadline postponements for Brexit from 29<sup>th</sup> March to 12<sup>th</sup> April, then to 31<sup>st</sup> October, the reality is that the possibility (never to be excluded) of a hard Brexit has been postponed to a date beyond peak milk production.  This is positive in that the trading conditions (no tariffs, no delay or paperwork at the border…) remain unchanged for longer than might have been the case with a no deal crash out this spring.</p>
<p>However, we hear from cheese traders that, with significant stockpiling ahead of the first 29<sup>th</sup> March deadline, and with strong increases in UK milk (+2.7% for February) and cheese production (+2.7% in the last 12 months), freshly produced UK cheddar is now competing with stockpiled Irish.  Quite a bit of retail promotions (i.e. competition based on reduced prices) is being reported.</p>
<p><strong>Oil prices strengthening importing countries’ purchasing power</strong></p>
<p>Since January, the Brent crude oil price has moved from around US$63 per barrel to a current US$72.</p>
<p>Higher oil prices always correlate to stronger dairy prices, because they increase the export earnings of many of our customer countries, such as the Middle East, North Africa and the likes.</p>
<p>With the trend currently up, this coincides with other factors to suggest better or at least more stable dairy prices over the coming weeks and months.</p>

Price stability justified for 2019
With subdued global milk supply growth, empty SMP intervention stores, a Brexit threat delayed well past peak and reasonable demand from China and Asia, all indicators point to stable dairy market prices after some earlier easing – which should spell stable milk prices.  So, why should co-ops at this point commit to no further milk price cuts for 2019?
Supply growth negative in February
Worldwide milk production by the main exporting nations has gone into negative territory in February (see graph below).
This reflects the continued severe downturn in Australian supplies (down 12.6% for February, and by 6.4% for the June to February period).
Also down are EU supplies: for the combined January and February period, they were 0.6% down in volume, with Germany, France and the Netherlands well back.  Exceptions worthy of note are of course Ireland and Poland.
US output was only up 0.2% for February, and growth there, which had been between 1.5% and 2% every month, year on year, has been much more subdued in recent months.
New Zealand had been forging ahead strongly through their October peak.  However, it started the calendar year in reverse, with February supplies down 0.12%, and March supplies well back by 7.4%!
With global output growth stable to negative, markets have taken good note of likely scarcer supplies later this year – which has translated most clearly into 10 consecutive positive GDT auctions, the last one earlier this week.

Source: USDEC
In their Quarter 1 Dairy Quarterly report, Rabobank do expect that lower output growth will remain the form for much of 2019, and they even go so far as to suggest that low growth might persist into 2020.  The main reason they give for this is the fall in milk prices over recent months to levels in most countries below production costs.
This expectation leads them to forecast stable milk prices for the first 2 quarters of 2019, possibly followed by some price improvements from the end of quarter 2.

Source: Rabobank
SMP intervention stocks empty
After the last sale of SMP out of intervention on 16th April, 33 tonnes at a minimum price of €1660/t, there is now only 1106t left for sale.  All of this will be made available for tender on 21st May.
A total of 378,504t have been sold out of intervention since the sales began in 2016.  With only just over 1000t left, stocks are quasi empty.  However, it is likely that some of this product has still to be absorbed in the market place.

Based on EU MMO
GDT scores 10 consecutive increases
Since early December 2018, all 10 GDT auctions have scored positive index increases, the latest one on 16th April at +0.5%.
The index has increased 28% since late November.  Butter prices, at US $5544/t are almost €800 dearer at current exchange rates than the most recent average EU butter prices.  SMP is almost €300/t dearer than EU product prices.  As a result, the latest SMP and butter prices would yield an “Irish” milk price of 36.32c/l + VAT.

Source: GDT
EU powder prices stable to firmer since January
There has been a divergence between price trends in GDT and global international markets, which have seen strong growth in butter and powder prices, and EU prices.
EU butter prices have been slipping early this year, yet remain above €4000/t, and so at historically high levels.  Whey powder prices have also been slipping somewhat.
However, SMP and WMP has both been firming since January, reflecting strong exports and the emptying of intervention stocks.
Cheddar cheese prices have been stable to slightly firmer, despite the Brexit fears.
 

Based on EU MMO
Brexit threat postponed, but…
After two deadline postponements for Brexit from 29th March to 12th April, then to 31st October, the reality is that the possibility (never to be excluded) of a hard Brexit has been postponed to a date beyond peak milk production.  This is positive in that the trading conditions (no tariffs, no delay or paperwork at the border…) remain unchanged for longer than might have been the case with a no deal crash out this spring.
However, we hear from cheese traders that, with significant stockpiling ahead of the first 29th March deadline, and with strong increases in UK milk (+2.7% for February) and cheese production (+2.7% in the last 12 months), freshly produced UK cheddar is now competing with stockpiled Irish.  Quite a bit of retail promotions (i.e. competition based on reduced prices) is being reported.
Oil prices strengthening importing countries’ purchasing power
Since January, the Brent crude oil price has moved from around US$63 per barrel to a current US$72.
Higher oil prices always correlate to stronger dairy prices, because they increase the export earnings of many of our customer countries, such as the Middle East, North Africa and the likes.
With the trend currently up, this coincides with other factors to suggest better or at least more stable dairy prices over the coming weeks and months.

Massively increased EU powder exports – SE Asia, MENA and Africa feature strongly
EU SMP export for Jan/Feb 2019 were a whopping 37% above exports for the same period last year.  This follows a full year performance up 5.4% in 2018 compared to 2017.
China, which has imported 172% more powder in Jan/Feb 19 than in the previous year, is closing in on Algeria as our main market for SMP, but all the main destinations of SE Asia, the Middle East and Africa above and below the Sahara have clocked up massive increases into the early months of 2019.

Cheese exports for the same period were strongly up too, by 7% compared to the same period last year.
This follows a historical year in which 832,000t of cheese were exported from the EU, the highest level in at least 7 years.
Demand from China continues strong
China is predicted by Rabobank in its 1st 2019 quarterly dairy report as remaining a strong feature in international dairy demand.  Domestic supplies will remain short of demand, and Rabo predicts accelerated import activity in the second half of the year.

<p>Speaking ahead of today’s National Dairy Committee meeting, Chairman Tom Phelan said the lobbying effort undertaken in recent days by IFA for March milk prices, which saw Committee members approach their local co-op board members with a 10-point campaign, would be revised today.</p>
<p>He said that further evidence of strong industry performance and figures showing significantly lower calf and cull cow sale revenues were further arguments proving that co-ops could, and should, hold the March milk price.</p>
<p>“We have outlined our “10 good reasons why co-ops must hold the March 2019 milk price”, and there are further factors which strengthen our case with co-op board members. I can’t emphasise enough just how critical cash flow is on dairy farms this time of year, and co-ops must maximise payout to farmers.,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“Confirming our contention that much appreciated supports to farmers during 2018 had not prevented a strong industry performance, the Ornua results were published, showing a 14.8% increase in operating profit.  Ornua will be paying a €19m year-end operating bonus to member co-ops, up 27% on the previous year.  This should help co-ops hold milk prices this spring,” he said.</p>
<p>“Also, as well as significant feed and fodder cost increases and lower milk prices squeezing margins by over 6c/l, dairy farmers are facing reduced revenue from cull cow and calf sales.

<p>IFA President Joe Healy said the Glanbia/Kepak Twenty/20 Beef Club represents much-needed new thinking for the sector.  He said the model on dairy beef could deliver greater certainty on beef prices and better cashflow on farms.</p>
<p><span id=""more-10576""></span></p>
<p>The IFA President said the contract-style pricing arrangement which Glanbia pioneered on dairy has worked well for dairy farmers and this move on beef could be a first step in a similar direction.  However, he said some of the detail needs closer examination. There would be concerns among farmers about having to purchase all of their inputs for all of their enterprises from Glanbia.</p>
<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan said this scheme encourages dairy farmers to produce a quality dairy beef animal through better breeding. It gives farmers the choice of rearing calves themselves, or selling them on to fellow-farmers to be reared in a sustainable manner.  “I believe it is important that all stakeholders, including co-ops, meat factories and AI societies in the beef and dairy sectors work together to develop a model for dairy beef which is sustainable and profitable for both beef and dairy farmers”.</p>
<p>He added that Glanbia/Kepak have explained that the scheme will be ‘anchored in the market’.  Farmers must be satisfied that the price benefits under the scheme are secured from the market place and do not in any way undermine beef prices outside the scheme.</p>
<p>IFA National Livestock Chairman Angus Woods said this move from Glanbia/Kepak involving greater certainty and reducing the risks on price is a new and important step forward for the beef sector.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said the reality is that for any beef system to be viable, including dairy beef, it must return a price above the cost of production and leave a margin for the farmer.</p>
<p>He said it is very important that beef farmers understand the precise details of the scheme, particularly the pricing model which is based on average quoted factory prices and the QPS (Quality Payment System) with additional bonuses.</p>
<p>Angus Woods said it appears that the ask from farmers in the scheme will evolve over time. Glanbia and Kepak must communicate this clearly and support farmers to generate the level of trust required for this scheme to progress and develop beyond the first two years of the pilot stage.</p>

IFA President Joe Healy welcomed today’s announcement of the completion of the Lakeland/LacPatrick merger.  He said this meant the merger, confirmed only days away from the UK exiting the EU, was vital for dairy farmers in the North East of the island of Ireland, and it must now be bedded down as soon as possible to start delivering for them.

Mr Healy said: “The merged entity must position itself in the best possible way to optimise dairy processing and marketing and to pay a strong price to farmers.  This is particularly critical in the context of Brexit, as both constituent co-ops have farmer members and processing facilities both sides of the border”.
IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan added: “I wish the new merged co-op the very best: dairy farmers in the North East need a strong co-op to defend their business interests, especially with a potentially problematic Brexit only days away”.

<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan said farmers were very disappointed that their first big milk cheque of the year had been reduced by price cuts when markets would have justified stability.  The prices cut by co-ops have fallen below the Ornua PPI equivalent, at a time when eight consecutive GDT auctions, including this week’s, show global dairy price improvements.</p>
<p><span id=""more-10516""></span></p>
<p>Compounding their annoyance, though, is the new trend among some co-ops when they cut milk prices to quote the month’s average milk price, inflated by the higher constituents achieved by farmers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The February milk pay-out was cut by between 0.5c/l and 1c/l by Glanbia, Kerry, Arrabawn and Dairygold thus far, to price levels below the Ornua PPI of 30.55c/l + VAT (32.2c/l incl VAT).  Those cuts are unfair to farmers who are still repaying bills from 2018,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Farmers are even more annoyed with the new trend of some co-ops when they cut milk prices to quote the average price for the month in question, which always reflects the higher constituents achieved by the farmers’ hard work. This is value added to milk by the farmers’ efforts which ensures co-ops have more butterfat and protein to process and export profitably,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If co-ops were coherent in this approach, they would also publish the higher price cut suffered by farmers at their actual constituent levels: a 1c/l price cut, measured at 3.3% protein and 3.6% butterfat, obviously equates to a higher price cut at higher constituents,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We appreciate the uncertainty that Brexit in particular is creating for dairy markets.  However, global indicators, including GDT, the Ornua PPI and the EU MMO returns all suggest that Irish milk prices paid for January were sustainable for February milk.</p>
<p>Co-ops must make it clear to their suppliers urgently what their plans are to return optimum and objectively presented milk prices over the coming months,” he concluded.</p>

<p><strong>2019 a year of relative dairy price stability – but with the uncertainty of Brexit</strong></p>
<p><strong>EU volumes edging up</strong></p>
<p>While the USDEC graph on the right indicates continued slower global milk output growth as far as January, more recent production trends are showing the early stages of a pick-up.</p>
<p>This, combined with the uncertainty of the Brexit situation (see more on Brexit below), is influencing markets towards greater caution.</p>
<p>EU milk deliveries for 2018 were up 0.9% only, and December was actually 1% down on December 2017.  The vagaries of weather during the year put pressure on most of the main milk producing countries, with fodder shortages and rising feed costs moderating supplies.</p>
<p>Dutch milk deliveries continue to be impacted by the herd restrictions related to phosphates implemented since last year.  January output was back over 5%, while production for the calendar year was down 2.9%.</p>
<p>French milk deliveries to the 9<sup>th</sup> week of the year (last week of February) were up 0.3% compared to the same week last year.  This is the first time that production exceeds the same week in the prior year since last August.  However, it leaves national output still well below the 5-year average, as has been the trend for practically all of 2018 (see graph right).<br>
The French milk output for the full calendar year 2018 were 0.2% down on 2017.</br></p>

<p>German output had also been depressed relative to 2017 since August 2018, but because it had been more expansive in the first half of the year, the annual output figure for 2018 was 1.7% higher than 2017.  After the more recent dip, production has now come to match last year’s in the third week of February.</p>
<p>Together, the Netherlands, France and Germany account for over 46% of all of the EU’s milk output – the trends in those strong dairy countries therefore determines the trend for the whole of the EU.</p>

<p><strong>Global supplies also picking up</strong></p>
<p>Estimates suggest that global collections have started to recover, albeit relatively modestly.  Global output is believed to be up 0.4% for January.</p>
<p>Within this, the US January output is estimated to be up 0.5% – a very much more modest rate than increases earlier in 2018.</p>
<p>New Zealand January supplies were up a massive 7.7% – albeit in comparison with a much weaker January 2018.  The June to December 2018 period, which includes both the trough and peak of the NZ season, was up 4.4%.</p>
<p>The short-term outlook in New Zealand is for continued output growth, weather permitting.  However, regulatory restrictions related to climate change and the environment will likely limit longer term expansion.</p>
<p>Australian production in 2018 has been beggared by a succession of drought and floods.  For January 2019, it is down a whopping 11% compared to the same month last year.  For the full year todate, this is down 5.8%.</p>

<p><strong>Demand strong in N Asia and China, stable to weak elsewhere</strong></p>
<p>Demand continues to grow strongly in North Asia.  Cream, cheese and liquid milk imports were weaker, but but were offset by strong butter and powder volumes with WMP particularly strong. After a sluggish Q2/Q3 period, Q4 imports were exceptionally strong. Jan imports have continued to grow steadily.</p>
<p>Chinese imports spefically have soared in January, and reflect two main things: first, the trade war with the US, and second the fact that the use of the NZ tariff free import quotas for WMP tend to be front loaded to the earliest part of the year.</p>

<p><strong>EU dairy prices in a lull</strong></p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2019, we have seen a renewed pick up in butter prices which had been easing through much of 2018.  In the last couple of months, however just as SMP prices were picking up in earnest, butter prices have lost ground.</p>
<p>EU average SMP prices seem to have plateaued around €1910/t, while spots have not been able to lift above €2000.</p>
<p>WMP prices have continued to firm steadily since the beginning of the year to reach an average of €2870/t.  Cheddar cheese has also been inching up to €3270/t, benefiting from Brexit-related stock piling.</p>
<p>Whey powder prices have been hovering since early January between €890/t and €850/t (currently €860/t), with both average prices and spots easing in most recent times.</p>

<p><strong>Dairy returns – most indicators stable to easier</strong></p>
<p>The table below tracks the returns from the main indicators available, from EU MMO average and raw milk spot prices, to the EU average dairy product spot prices, to the Ornua PPI and the GDT auction of 5<sup>th</sup> March (next one is on next Tuesday 19<sup>th</sup>March).</p>
<p>Most European based indicators would return a stable to easier milk price equivalent, while the GDT, which was on its 7<sup>th</sup>consecutive uptick on 5<sup>th</sup> March, was well up, but from low levels.</p>
<p>That said, the improved GDT prices since early December have led Fonterra to revise upwards their forecast milk price for the 2018/19 season to between NZ$6.30 and 6.60 (26.28 to 27.54c/l), with a dividend of 15 to 25 cents in addition – a total payout of up to 28.58c/l.  Not great, but a major improvement on earlier forecast.</p>

<p><strong>Brexit – new tariffs would damage Irish exports competitiveness in case of No Deal</strong></p>
<p>Not a lot to say about Brexit, other than the British Parliament has this week successively voted against the Withdrawal Agreement agreed last December between the UK and the EU (including Backstop), against a “No-Deal” Brexit, and last night in favour of looking for a postponement of the 29<sup>th</sup> March exit date.</p>
<p>Voting against the “No Deal” is well and good, but in the absence of a deal – and the Parliament has voted against the only deal on the table – the potential remains for the UK to crash out on 29<sup>th</sup> March or later if a delay is granted.  The likely length of the delay is unclear – UK wants short, EU wants longer, but both have implications which are well documented in media reports, so I won’t go into it.</p>
<p>Importantly, the British Government have published a set of import tariffs they would be implementing in the event of a “No Deal” Brexit.  For a number of products – not just food products – the tariffs are set at zero.  For many products, including food products, they are set at WTO levels.  However, for a number of food sectors, the tariffs are set at a variety of levels, mostly less than WTO tariffs.</p>
<p>Should a “No Deal” Brexit arise, the tariffs would apply to all imports of those products into the UK, regardless of provenance – putting Irish and, say, US or NZ imports into the UK in the same situation, but making Irish exports to the UK significantly less competitive.</p>
<p>Dairy specific tariffs are proposed by the UK government for two dairy products only for which all imports from anywhere would face those tariffs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheddar €221/t (normal WTO tariff is €1671/t) – <strong>the new UK tariff for Cheddar is equivalent to 2.26c/l</strong></li>
<li>Butter €605/t (normal WTO tariff is €1896/t) – <strong>UK tariff for butter alone is equivalent to 2.6c/l</strong> – note this does not allow for SMP tariff, which would be WTO level, and would add substantially to this.</li>
</ul>
<p>The uncertainty around Brexit, the yo-yo effect on Sterling and the stockpiling which has boosted demand in recent months but could depress it even in the case of a Brexit postponement or deal, all have created greater caution on milk prices by all milk purchasers around Europe, including Ireland.</p>

2019 a year of relative dairy price stability – but with the uncertainty of Brexit
EU volumes edging up
While the USDEC graph on the right indicates continued slower global milk output growth as far as January, more recent production trends are showing the early stages of a pick-up.
This, combined with the uncertainty of the Brexit situation (see more on Brexit below), is influencing markets towards greater caution.
EU milk deliveries for 2018 were up 0.9% only, and December was actually 1% down on December 2017.  The vagaries of weather during the year put pressure on most of the main milk producing countries, with fodder shortages and rising feed costs moderating supplies.
Dutch milk deliveries continue to be impacted by the herd restrictions related to phosphates implemented since last year.  January output was back over 5%, while production for the calendar year was down 2.9%.
French milk deliveries to the 9th week of the year (last week of February) were up 0.3% compared to the same week last year.  This is the first time that production exceeds the same week in the prior year since last August.  However, it leaves national output still well below the 5-year average, as has been the trend for practically all of 2018 (see graph right).
The French milk output for the full calendar year 2018 were 0.2% down on 2017.

German output had also been depressed relative to 2017 since August 2018, but because it had been more expansive in the first half of the year, the annual output figure for 2018 was 1.7% higher than 2017.  After the more recent dip, production has now come to match last year’s in the third week of February.
Together, the Netherlands, France and Germany account for over 46% of all of the EU’s milk output – the trends in those strong dairy countries therefore determines the trend for the whole of the EU.

Other important production countries are already in a strong upward trend, namely the UK (+0.2% for the full year, but 2.5% for the second half of February), Denmark (+2% for December) and Poland (+2.6% for the full calendar year, and +2.8% for December).

Global supplies also picking up
Estimates suggest that global collections have started to recover, albeit relatively modestly.  Global output is believed to be up 0.4% for January.
Within this, the US January output is estimated to be up 0.5% – a very much more modest rate than increases earlier in 2018.
New Zealand January supplies were up a massive 7.7% – albeit in comparison with a much weaker January 2018.  The June to December 2018 period, which includes both the trough and peak of the NZ season, was up 4.4%.
The short-term outlook in New Zealand is for continued output growth, weather permitting.  However, regulatory restrictions related to climate change and the environment will likely limit longer term expansion.
Australian production in 2018 has been beggared by a succession of drought and floods.  For January 2019, it is down a whopping 11% compared to the same month last year.  For the full year todate, this is down 5.8%.

Demand strong in N Asia and China, stable to weak elsewhere
Demand continues to grow strongly in North Asia.  Cream, cheese and liquid milk imports were weaker, but but were offset by strong butter and powder volumes with WMP particularly strong. After a sluggish Q2/Q3 period, Q4 imports were exceptionally strong. Jan imports have continued to grow steadily.
Chinese imports spefically have soared in January, and reflect two main things: first, the trade war with the US, and second the fact that the use of the NZ tariff free import quotas for WMP tend to be front loaded to the earliest part of the year.

In South East Asia, 2018 saw higher levels of imports, driven by strong SMP demand (no doubt boosted by low prices), WMP and whey.  On the other hand, imports of butter and cheese fell.
In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), 2018 saw a limited recovery in import levels after a depressed 2017 – again, price levels being the influential factor.  The first quarter of 2018 was the strongest, and imports eased thereafter.  Butter imports were down, with SMP and cheese up slightly, and WMP also on the up.
In the Western world, EU domestic demand has been quiet, cheese and butter growth sluggish.  Domestic SMP consumption has been weaker, but exports have increased strongly.  Domestic WMP consumption has also increased.
In the US and North America generally, cheese consumption has held up well in 2018.  Butter demand had eased, but has recovered towards year end.  Domestic consumption and exports of SMP are weak.




Oil prices and affordability of dairy product prices
The export earnings of oil producing countries have been affected by relatively low oil prices in recent months.  Since the end of 2018, prices have dropped from around US$ 80 to around US$60-65, dropping even to US$50 in January.
Lower oil revenues affect the ability of some emerging countries to afford food imports, including dairy products, and so there is always a positive correlation between high oil prices and strong demand for dairy products, leading to higher dairy products.  The opposite is happening at the moment.
That said, lower dairy prices for much of 2018, and easier butter prices since the history busting highs of 2017, have made products more affordable.

EU dairy prices in a lull
Since the beginning of 2019, we have seen a renewed pick up in butter prices which had been easing through much of 2018.  In the last couple of months, however just as SMP prices were picking up in earnest, butter prices have lost ground.
EU average SMP prices seem to have plateaued around €1910/t, while spots have not been able to lift above €2000.
WMP prices have continued to firm steadily since the beginning of the year to reach an average of €2870/t.  Cheddar cheese has also been inching up to €3270/t, benefiting from Brexit-related stock piling.
Whey powder prices have been hovering since early January between €890/t and €850/t (currently €860/t), with both average prices and spots easing in most recent times.

Dairy returns – most indicators stable to easier
The table below tracks the returns from the main indicators available, from EU MMO average and raw milk spot prices, to the EU average dairy product spot prices, to the Ornua PPI and the GDT auction of 5th March (next one is on next Tuesday 19thMarch).
Most European based indicators would return a stable to easier milk price equivalent, while the GDT, which was on its 7thconsecutive uptick on 5th March, was well up, but from low levels.
That said, the improved GDT prices since early December have led Fonterra to revise upwards their forecast milk price for the 2018/19 season to between NZ$6.30 and 6.60 (26.28 to 27.54c/l), with a dividend of 15 to 25 cents in addition – a total payout of up to 28.58c/l.  Not great, but a major improvement on earlier forecast.

Brexit – new tariffs would damage Irish exports competitiveness in case of No Deal
Not a lot to say about Brexit, other than the British Parliament has this week successively voted against the Withdrawal Agreement agreed last December between the UK and the EU (including Backstop), against a “No-Deal” Brexit, and last night in favour of looking for a postponement of the 29th March exit date.
Voting against the “No Deal” is well and good, but in the absence of a deal – and the Parliament has voted against the only deal on the table – the potential remains for the UK to crash out on 29th March or later if a delay is granted.  The likely length of the delay is unclear – UK wants short, EU wants longer, but both have implications which are well documented in media reports, so I won’t go into it.
Importantly, the British Government have published a set of import tariffs they would be implementing in the event of a “No Deal” Brexit.  For a number of products – not just food products – the tariffs are set at zero.  For many products, including food products, they are set at WTO levels.  However, for a number of food sectors, the tariffs are set at a variety of levels, mostly less than WTO tariffs.
Should a “No Deal” Brexit arise, the tariffs would apply to all imports of those products into the UK, regardless of provenance – putting Irish and, say, US or NZ imports into the UK in the same situation, but making Irish exports to the UK significantly less competitive.
Dairy specific tariffs are proposed by the UK government for two dairy products only for which all imports from anywhere would face those tariffs:

Cheddar €221/t (normal WTO tariff is €1671/t) – the new UK tariff for Cheddar is equivalent to 2.26c/l
Butter €605/t (normal WTO tariff is €1896/t) – UK tariff for butter alone is equivalent to 2.6c/l – note this does not allow for SMP tariff, which would be WTO level, and would add substantially to this.

The uncertainty around Brexit, the yo-yo effect on Sterling and the stockpiling which has boosted demand in recent months but could depress it even in the case of a Brexit postponement or deal, all have created greater caution on milk prices by all milk purchasers around Europe, including Ireland.

<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan today (Tuesday) said the decision by Lakeland to maintain their milk price at 30.6c/l + VAT was justified by current market returns and was to be welcomed.  On the other hand, the Glanbia cut in the co-op contribution to their payout by 0.5c/l, unmatched by a corresponding increase in the base, reduces the payout to farmers to 29.88c/l + VAT.</p>
<p>While farmers appreciate co-op support, current market returns would justify a higher payout than Glanbia is currently returning, and GII should be able to pay a competitive base price without the need for co-op support.  Mr Phelan urged all other co-ops to reflect the firmer European and global market returns, especially for powders, and to bear in mind in their decisions the improved trend in global market prices clearly indicated by seven successive GDT auctions.</p>
<p>“Though EU butter prices have continued to ease, powder returns have been firming for a few months.  IFA has shown that returns from a number of EU and global indicators at the end of February would return milk prices equivalent to between 30c/l and 32.5c/l + VAT.  Indeed, even the Ornua PPI for February is equivalent to 30.55c/l + VAT,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“The decision by the board to cut the top up without at least an equivalent increase in the GII base is a let down for Glanbia suppliers.</p>
<p>I urge all co-op boards who have yet to meet to decide on milk prices to duly recognise and reflect current firmer market returns by at least holding their February milk prices,” he concluded.</p>

<p>Addressing a seminar organised by IFA on Producer Organisations today, IFA President Joe Healy said producer groups have shown their ability to organise farmers very well and negotiate additional top-up bonus prices with processors. However, the meat plants have found a way of undermining this by using very low quoted prices every week.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said, “We are also aware of numerous situations where processors and agents have used every trick in the book to pick off members of producer groups to see if they can divide and break up groups”.</p>
<p>In the livestock and beef sector, both the present Minister Michael Creed and his predecessor Minister Coveney have spoken a lot about the opportunity for beef farmers to set up producer organisations. In theory, this is positive. But the reality is the dominant retailers and meat processors hold all the cards.</p>
<p>Producer Organisations need a lot more support and particularly financial support from the Department of Agriculture. €1,500 to set up a group and €1,500 for legal advice is not sufficient. Groups need ongoing support on an annual basis, especially in the early years to keep going, if they have any chance of being able to stand up to the dominance of the powerful retailers and processors.</p>
<p>The food supply chain is characterised by a concentration of buying power in the hands of a small number of powerful retail groups. In Ireland alone, the top three of SuperValu, Dunnes and Tesco have 67% of retail food sales. Two multinational discounters Aldi and Lidl have another 21.5% share of the market between them.</p>
<p>On the beef processing side, the big three groups of ABP, Dawn and Kepak have 65% of the total market between them.</p>
<p>“As farmers, this is the power of the retail and processing sectors we are up against. IFA wants to support producer organisations, where farmers wish to set up groups. We have registered with the Department of Agriculture as an approved facilitator.  We are available to help and assist any group of farmer members wishing to set up a producer organisation in any sector,” he said.</p>
<p>Over the years, the IFA has played a key leadership role in the formation of up to 60 farmer co-operatives in the livestock marts business. We were also key to the establishment of groups and co-operatives in the dairy sector.</p>
<p>IFA was instrumental in the establishment of up to 20 producer groups in the sheep area. Our farmer members were to the fore in the setting up of beef producer groups over the years in Laois, Monaghan, Cork, Longford and Louth.</p>
<p>IFA has also been to the fore across other areas like horticulture, mushrooms and other areas in assisting farmers in forming groups.  Family farms are been forced out through globalisation and the constant race to the bottom on prices.  Farmers cannot survive the downward price pressure being pushed back against them.</p>
<p>In Ireland, the establishment of co-ops by farmers have proven to be a major success and has delivered in spades for farmers. This is particularly the case in dairy processing and also in livestock marts. It’s not the case in beef, sheep or pig meat processing.</p>

<p>German milk output has also been below year-earlier for almost all of the same period (from August 2018 todate).</p>
<p>Between them, France and Germany account for 37% of all the milk produced in the EU 28.</p>
<p>Dutch milk production has fallen 2.92% in the January to December period according to ZuivelNL, the Dutch dairy industry organisation.  This is due to the restriction on the national dairy herd imposed to reduce phosphate output.  Dutch milk supplies account for a further 9.4% of EU supplies.</p>

<p>UK milk supplies have been increasing in recent months, rising above 2017/18 output since November.</p>
<p>December 2018 UK output was up 1.7%, but the April to year end output was level for GB, and up 2.3% for NI.  The UK accounts for 9.6% of EU supplies (see pie chart below).</p>

<p>More dynamic countries from a milk production perspective include Denmark (up 2.5% for the full year, and 2% for December); Poland (up 2.6% for the full year, up 3% for November) and of course Ireland (up 4.3% for the full year, up 23.2% for the month of December).</p>
<p>Poland accounts for 7.3% of overall EU supplies, with Ireland at 4.5%, and Denmark at 4%.</p>
<p>So, with almost 50% of the EU’s milk output in negative growth, the EU’s milk production has been restrained in recent months, with November output down 0.8% and predictions that this trend will likely continue into spring 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Global supplies: a mixed picture, but flat at back end</strong></p>
<p>Global milk supplies were estimated to be up 1% for 2018, but flat at year end because the EU, Argentina and Australia are all well down.</p>
<p>US output was up moderately, 0.8% for November (no more recent figures due to Government shutdown) and +1.2% for the January to November period.</p>
<p>New Zealand production continued to increase strongly, by 2.3% for the year, and 4.4% in December alone.  However, restrictions from environmental legislation enacted by the current Labour government will likely reduce scope for growth in the medium to longer term.</p>

<p><strong>Intervention stocks depleted to almost nothing – with rising sales price</strong></p>
<p>Almost all the over 400,000t of SMP sold into intervention since 14/15 have been sold out, with recent prices keeping pace with fresh feed grade prices of around €1660-1670 (German and Dutch, 6<sup>th</sup> Feb quote).  The latest minimum price adjudicated for sale of intervention powder was €1622/t on 2<sup>nd</sup> February.  As the range of bids was up to €1710, some product will have sold for a higher price up to that maximum.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the 3,500t which were left to sell did not find buyers, only 584 tonnes were sold.  Spain, the UK, Slovakia and Finland are the countries where this left-over product is stored.  All Irish stock has been sold.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, the intervention stores are now as good as empty, and with restrained fresh milk supplies, the price of powder will hopefully continue to firm.</p>

<p><strong>Dairy prices stable to firmer</strong></p>
<p>The firming of powder and butter prices we have seen in recent weeks has continued in a more modest way.</p>
<p>The nominal Irish product mix whose returns we follow on the basis of the EU Milk Market Observatory weekly average price reports has improved by around 1.3 cents per litre from early January to early February.</p>
<p>Based on the EU MMO average prices quoted for 3<sup>rd</sup> February, the representative Irish product mix would return gross 36.1c/l before processing costs.  Assuming the deduction of a nominal 5c/l for processing costs, this would be equivalent to 31.1c/l + VAT, or 32.78c/l incl VAT.  This is around 0.5c/l more than the average of the FJ League for milk purchased in the month of December.</p>

<p><strong>Returns – improvements should help hold milk prices in short term</strong></p>

EU supplies down in early 2019
French milk supplies were down -3.1% in week 4 of 2019 (see graph right) and (most recent monthly figure available) down 3.7% in November 18 compared to November 17.
This is the continuation of an ongoing trend towards significantly lower output compared to previous year since the first week of August 2018.  Also, output has been consistently below the 5-year average (yellow line in graph below) since almost this time last year.

German milk output has also been below year-earlier for almost all of the same period (from August 2018 todate).
Between them, France and Germany account for 37% of all the milk produced in the EU 28.
Dutch milk production has fallen 2.92% in the January to December period according to ZuivelNL, the Dutch dairy industry organisation.  This is due to the restriction on the national dairy herd imposed to reduce phosphate output.  Dutch milk supplies account for a further 9.4% of EU supplies.













Source: ZMB




UK milk supplies have been increasing in recent months, rising above 2017/18 output since November.
December 2018 UK output was up 1.7%, but the April to year end output was level for GB, and up 2.3% for NI.  The UK accounts for 9.6% of EU supplies (see pie chart below).

More dynamic countries from a milk production perspective include Denmark (up 2.5% for the full year, and 2% for December); Poland (up 2.6% for the full year, up 3% for November) and of course Ireland (up 4.3% for the full year, up 23.2% for the month of December).
Poland accounts for 7.3% of overall EU supplies, with Ireland at 4.5%, and Denmark at 4%.
So, with almost 50% of the EU’s milk output in negative growth, the EU’s milk production has been restrained in recent months, with November output down 0.8% and predictions that this trend will likely continue into spring 2019.




Global supplies: a mixed picture, but flat at back end
Global milk supplies were estimated to be up 1% for 2018, but flat at year end because the EU, Argentina and Australia are all well down.
US output was up moderately, 0.8% for November (no more recent figures due to Government shutdown) and +1.2% for the January to November period.
New Zealand production continued to increase strongly, by 2.3% for the year, and 4.4% in December alone.  However, restrictions from environmental legislation enacted by the current Labour government will likely reduce scope for growth in the medium to longer term.

Intervention stocks depleted to almost nothing – with rising sales price
Almost all the over 400,000t of SMP sold into intervention since 14/15 have been sold out, with recent prices keeping pace with fresh feed grade prices of around €1660-1670 (German and Dutch, 6th Feb quote).  The latest minimum price adjudicated for sale of intervention powder was €1622/t on 2nd February.  As the range of bids was up to €1710, some product will have sold for a higher price up to that maximum.
Remarkably, the 3,500t which were left to sell did not find buyers, only 584 tonnes were sold.  Spain, the UK, Slovakia and Finland are the countries where this left-over product is stored.  All Irish stock has been sold.
For all intents and purposes, the intervention stores are now as good as empty, and with restrained fresh milk supplies, the price of powder will hopefully continue to firm.





Based on EU MMO data




Dairy prices stable to firmer
The firming of powder and butter prices we have seen in recent weeks has continued in a more modest way.
The nominal Irish product mix whose returns we follow on the basis of the EU Milk Market Observatory weekly average price reports has improved by around 1.3 cents per litre from early January to early February.
Based on the EU MMO average prices quoted for 3rd February, the representative Irish product mix would return gross 36.1c/l before processing costs.  Assuming the deduction of a nominal 5c/l for processing costs, this would be equivalent to 31.1c/l + VAT, or 32.78c/l incl VAT.  This is around 0.5c/l more than the average of the FJ League for milk purchased in the month of December.

Based on EU MMO data
 
Spot quotes, which had stalled and eased in recent days, are also firming again very slightly for SMP and whey in early February (table below).

Returns – improvements should help hold milk prices in short term
Most of the indicators we follow on the market place have improved by 1c/l or more in the last month to month and a half.  This reflects continuous improvement in powder prices (especially SMP) and while butter prices had been easing for several months, they have been firming slightly in recent days/weeks.
The average price paid by co-ops for December milk was, based on the Farmers’ Journal milk league, 30.67c/l + VAT.  The below suggests that this would be comfortably sustainable based on current (late Jan to early Feb) returns as illustrated by a variety of Irish, EU and international indicators.

<p>Following a visit to Cherbourg, France, IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan and Livestock Chairman Angus Woods today (Friday) said there is real scope for increased quality lairage capacity for Irish calf exports in the area.</p>
<p>The two IFA farm leaders called on Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed, his officials and all stakeholders in the sector to engage with their relevant counterparts and partners at national and regional level in France to help make this happen.</p>
<p>“We met with the two lairage operators in Cherbourg, and found their facilities to be of very high standard, professionally run by committed staff using best practice which are being controlled by the regional veterinary authorities whom we also met,” the two Chairmen said.</p>
<p>Tom Phelan added: “At a meeting with the Port Authorities, we established that there is real appetite in the region to develop and support the logistical capacity for all types of export activity, especially in the context of Brexit.  Our meetings with the lairage operators have shown that they like working with Irish calf exporters and are positively disposed towards catering for increased capacity in future”.</p>
<p>Angus Woods added “Our trip was not just about gathering information.  We also wanted to give justified confidence to the local lairage operators, veterinary and Port authorities that the export of calves in best practice conditions out of Ireland was a sustainable trade flow which, while highly seasonal, would see a steady increase and justify continued and additional investment in facilities”.</p>

<p>With spring calving now underway on many Irish farms, IFA Health and Safety Executive William Shortall has urged farmers to be particularly vigilant to ensure their own safety.</p>
<p>An average, 9% of farm fatalities are caused by cow and heifer attacks each year, with farmers more vulnerable to accidents at this time of year due to tiredness brought on by the heavy workload of spring. This is compounded by the fact that heifers and cows can be unpredictable at calving time and may hit out without warning.</p>
<p>According to IFA Health and Safety Executive William Shortall, “Spring is the busiest time of year on many Irish farms. Farmers work around the clock, often needing to be up several times a night to check on animals. This can lead to severe tiredness, restricting a farmers ability to react quickly.”</p>
<p>The IFA has developed some useful tips for farmers to help keep them safe, including:</p>
<p>•               Don’t be afraid to ask for help from a neighbour with a difficult cow or calving<br>
•               Know your limitations, you’re not as agile as you were this time last year<br>
•               Make sure the calving gate is operating properly<br>

•               Make sure all dogs and children are out of sight before entering the pen<br>
•               Make sure the cow is correctly locked into the calving gate<br>
•               Ensure calving pens have appropriate lighting<br>

The main hazards associated with slurry are toxic slurry gas, slurry tank and lagoon openings and the slurry spreader PTO shaft.</p>
<p>“Spreading slurry is potentially one of the most hazardous activities that a farmer undertakes. The two main risks that present are drowning and gas poisoning. We are urging farmers not to take unnecessary risks and follow simple steps to ensure their own safety and that of their animals,” said William Shortall.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on SMP: markets recover globally as intervention stocks collapse</strong></p>
<p>The positive indicators for SMP markets have continued to mount up into the New Year, the most remarkable probably being the rapid sales of increasingly large tonnages out of intervention at rising prices.  A total of 357,345 tonnes have been sold out of intervention in the period from December 2016 to-date, leaving only around 22,000t in stock after a whopping 80,242t were sold earlier this week.</p>
<p>The minimum sales prices have been rising since last July, now practically matching fresh Dutch and German spot quotes for feed grade powder.  At €1554, the most recent minimum accepted price was about on par with the EU average spot quotes for feed grade powder quoted for 9<sup>th</sup> January 2019.<a href=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SMP-intervention-sales.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-78486 lazy"" data-src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SMP-intervention-sales.png"" height=""540"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""980""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-78486"" height=""540"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SMP-intervention-sales.png"" width=""980""/></noscript></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Based on EU MMO data.</p>
<p>With very strong SMP exports out of the EU in 2018, all SMP price quotes are also on the up, from EU market averages to GDT trends, as are forward indicators such as spot quotes and futures. Now that intervention stocks have dropped to below their March 2016 level, will we see a continued recovery in SMP prices, and a rebalancing of the butter/powder prices to more “normal” levels? GDT SMP prices have been rising steeply in the last three auctions – albeit from very low prices – to a level of US$ 2,200 last seen in June 2017. <a href=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GDT-SMP-prices.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-78487 lazy"" data-src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GDT-SMP-prices.png"" height=""447"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""841""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-78487"" height=""447"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GDT-SMP-prices.png"" width=""841""/></noscript></a></p>

<p>European spot quotes for food grade SMP have also improved consistently in recent weeks, with Kempten (German), France Agrimer and Dutch PZ quotes now at €1830/tonne.  We are even hearing anecdotal trade at prices nearing €1900/t.</p>
<p>This is happening at the same time as significant sales out of intervention for what must by now be feed grade SMP are reaching prices that are on par with fresh feed grade product spot prices.</p>
<p>On 9<sup>th</sup> January, the Dutch PZ spot quote for feed grade powder was €1580/t, while the German (Kempten) quote was €1550/t – about the same as the most recent minimum intervention selling price.  While the spot market trends suggest where average market returns will become in the short term, futures deal with the medium to longer term trends.</p>
<p>Even futures markets are looking up for SMP, with latest EEX quotes suggest prices rising above €2000/t by the end of 2019.</p>
<p>Average EU market prices also reflect this same trend. In the first week of January 2019, they reached €1730/t.</p>
<p>It is also the improvement in the spot and market prices of SMP which caused the December Ornua PPI to increase from 104.9 points to 107.5, equivalent to a milk price of 30.55c/l + VAT (32.2c/l incl VAT).</p>

Focus on SMP: markets recover globally as intervention stocks collapse
The positive indicators for SMP markets have continued to mount up into the New Year, the most remarkable probably being the rapid sales of increasingly large tonnages out of intervention at rising prices.  A total of 357,345 tonnes have been sold out of intervention in the period from December 2016 to-date, leaving only around 22,000t in stock after a whopping 80,242t were sold earlier this week.
The minimum sales prices have been rising since last July, now practically matching fresh Dutch and German spot quotes for feed grade powder.  At €1554, the most recent minimum accepted price was about on par with the EU average spot quotes for feed grade powder quoted for 9th January 2019.
Based on EU MMO data.
With very strong SMP exports out of the EU in 2018, all SMP price quotes are also on the up, from EU market averages to GDT trends, as are forward indicators such as spot quotes and futures. Now that intervention stocks have dropped to below their March 2016 level, will we see a continued recovery in SMP prices, and a rebalancing of the butter/powder prices to more “normal” levels? GDT SMP prices have been rising steeply in the last three auctions – albeit from very low prices – to a level of US$ 2,200 last seen in June 2017. 
Source: GDT
European spot quotes for food grade SMP have also improved consistently in recent weeks, with Kempten (German), France Agrimer and Dutch PZ quotes now at €1830/tonne.  We are even hearing anecdotal trade at prices nearing €1900/t.
This is happening at the same time as significant sales out of intervention for what must by now be feed grade SMP are reaching prices that are on par with fresh feed grade product spot prices.
On 9th January, the Dutch PZ spot quote for feed grade powder was €1580/t, while the German (Kempten) quote was €1550/t – about the same as the most recent minimum intervention selling price.  While the spot market trends suggest where average market returns will become in the short term, futures deal with the medium to longer term trends.
Even futures markets are looking up for SMP, with latest EEX quotes suggest prices rising above €2000/t by the end of 2019.
Average EU market prices also reflect this same trend. In the first week of January 2019, they reached €1730/t.
It is also the improvement in the spot and market prices of SMP which caused the December Ornua PPI to increase from 104.9 points to 107.5, equivalent to a milk price of 30.55c/l + VAT (32.2c/l incl VAT).

<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan said the decision by Aurivo, uniquely among co-ops, to cut their milk price for a second month running was a real let down for their suppliers, at a time when markets and the outlook for 2019 justifies price stability.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>“Our research shows that that the majority of indices relevant to EU dairy markets, whether it is EU MMO average market prices, spot prices and futures for the first half of 2019 suggest a milk price equivalent of around 30c/l + VAT.

<p><strong>Some real positives on dairy markets for early 2019</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Less milk about</strong></p>
<p>Global supplies of milk have continued to grow into October, but, at an estimated +0.6%, this is at a very much more modest pace than heretofore.</p>
<p>Weather related fodder shortages and cost shocks continue to impact EU (-0.4% in Oct; +1.4% ytd), and Australian (-5.7% in Oct, -0.6% ytd) output.</p>
<p>While the US continue to show positive growth (+1.1% ytd), it is relatively modest at +0.8% for Oct.</p>
<p>Of the main dairy regions, only New Zealand is motoring on, up 5.8% for Oct, and up 2.2% for Jan-Oct.<br>
Slightly less important in tonnages produced is Argentina, though Oct supplies were +2.1% – compared to a low performance this time last year – and ytd + 5.6%. Brazil was down 0.2% Jan-Sept.</br></p>

<div style=""text-align: center;"">Source: USDEC</div>
<p>European supplies, while well down on the whole for October, show a mixed picture when one look at individual producing countries.</p>
<p>France, Germany and the Netherland account for, between them 46% of the EU’s milk supplies, and 51% of its dairy exports.  Those three countries are all producing less milk this back end than last year, the Netherlands at least to end the year with less milk than 2017 – France produced 4.4% less milk in October, Germany -1% and the Netherlands -5.5%.</p>
<p>UK milk supplies were practically static at +0.4% for October, despite very strong growth in Northern Ireland, suggesting lower output in the rest of the UK.</p>
<p>Finland reported losing 50% of its grass crop to the drought over the summer, so that production will be down 0.5% this year and the Finns predict it will fall a further1.1% next year.<br>
Austria’s milk supplies are also down, and the Italians expect their milk production to fall in the last quarter of 2018.</br></p>
<p>Supplies from other countries, on the other hand, have staged a recovery after the heat wave and drought of the summer.  Ireland most of all increased October production by 20.1%, raising January to October output by 2.8%, with expectations of further significant growth in November.  Denmark is also showing some growth, while Poland continue to grow production by over 2% ytd.</p>

<p><strong>2. A turnaround in GDT trend?</strong></p>
<p>Today’s GDT auction was the second positive one after a long stretch of price falls since last May.  Are we seeing a turn-around?  NZ supplies have increased massively in recent months, but we are now well past the NZ peak, and ahead of the Northern Hemisphere main season.  Concerns over slower and even negative supply growth in the short to medium term is clearly influencing even Oceanian price trends.</p>
<p>At US$3928 (€3454/t), the average GDT butter price is up 4.9% on the previous auction, but remains well below current EU average butter prices.  At $2042/t (€1796), GDT SMP prices are a little above rising EU levels.</p>

<p><strong>3. More SMP selling fast out of intervention at rising prices</strong></p>
<p>SMP has been open for buy-in since 2014, in the wake of the Russian embargo on all EU foodstuffs.  A total of over 405,000t was sold into intervention between 2015 and 2017.  There was no SMP accepted into intervention in 2018, and after a couple of unsuccessful tenders, operators got the message and stopped offering it in.</p>
<p>In 2016, 40t of SMP were sold out.  In 2017, this increased to a still modest 180 tonnes.  2018 saw the bulk of the sales, with 276,883t sold out by the last December 2018 tender.  From October, the number of monthly tender was doubled to 2, though December had only the one.</p>
<p>Next January, the totality of what is left in stock namely just over 102,000t, will be available for the next two tenders.</p>
<p>EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan has seriously suggested that the entire stock could be gone by next spring.</p>
<p>The most interesting aspect of the intervention sales is how they have increased in pace while the sales price has also been increasing.</p>

<p><strong>4. Rising fresh SMP market prices</strong></p>
<p>SMP prices have been firming progressively since mid-October, coinciding with the largest sales out of intervention (see graph above).</p>

<p><strong>5. Demand somewhat flat currently but looking to improve in New Year</strong></p>
<p>Demand growth had been assessed at around +1.5% earlier this year.  Lower oil prices, trade tariff disputes and weaker economic growth in many regions has flattened it a little in the last quarter of the year.</p>
<p>However, Chinese demand has increased in the earlier part of 2018, and is expected to increase in 2019 also.</p>
<p>Rabobank predict that, in 2019, Chinese demand will increase in double digits.  The cost of production is rising in China, with feed costs on the up partly as a result of the tariff/trade war with the US.  Chinese economic growth is however somewhat uncertain and this will impact demand for additional imports.  Even allowing for this, however, Rabobank predicts an increase in Chinese dairy consumption for 2019 of 1.5% year on year.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Source: Eucolait</p>
<p>In South East Asia, powder demand (including casein) has increased after a poor start to the year.  Butter and cheese imports have also increased, though from low levels.</p>
<p>Rabobank predict that the relative global production squeeze is set to continue into 2019, and bearing in mind relatively low levels of privately held stock – also fast shrinking SMP intervention inventories – and continued steady demand, they say there is a real risk that buyers may get caught out with the market “moving quickly upwards and catching them unawares” in the first half of the New Year.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Not all rosy: Brexit, oil prices, international tariff wars</strong></p>
<p>As 2018 comes to a close, there are some headwinds.</p>
<p>Brexit Day, 29<sup>th</sup> March 2019, is just over 100 days away, and the British, Irish Governments and the EU are now openly talking about preparing for the UK crashing out without a deal (a Hard Brexit).</p>
<p>It is worth reminding ourselves of a few dairy facts when it comes to our trade with the UK.</p>
<p>The UK imports 476,533 tonnes of all manners of dairy products from Ireland, but most of all cheese (138,000t) including a majority of Cheddar, and butter (49,000t).</p>
<p>They also export around 936,520 tonnes of dairy products to Ireland – this is mostly raw liquid milk from Northern Ireland which is being processed in the ROI.</p>
<p>So, firstly, the value of the UK imports from Ireland exceed its exports in value terms; and secondly, there may not be sufficient capacity within the UK to process the NI milk which is currently being processed in the ROI.</p>
<p>Hence, to quote the CLAL presentation from which the graph right and the information above is sourced, “Aside from political considerations, market equilibrium calls for the existence of a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU in order to limit the effect of Brexit on the constituents of the supply chain”.</p>

<p>The most immediately apparent negative impact from the political chaos and uncertainty surrounding Brexit development is the weakness of Sterling.  It makes our exports less competitive, and makes UK/NI milk cheaper to import, playing into the hands of retailers intent on unsustainable discounting, especially around Christmas as we have seen this week with fresh vegetables!</p>

<p>Oil prices had risen very significantly during 2018, increasing export earnings for many emerging countries which rely on them to import their food necessities including dairy products.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, increased supply and the fear of economic headwinds potentially reducing demand has impacted crude oil prices, which have fallen dramatically to levels last experienced over 12 months ago.</p>
<p>Crude Brent oil went from US$87.54/barrel on 3<sup>rd</sup> October to around US$58-59/barrel in early December.</p>
<p>While Saudi Arabia is believed to be unlikely to risk upsetting the US by pushing too hard for OPEC output restraint (which would push up oil prices), Rabobank and other analysts nonetheless expect 2019 oil prices to average out in excess of 2018.</p>
<p>International tariff wars have also increased uncertainty on global markets.  Trade tariffs imposed by the US on China in particular have increased the cost of feed, and consequently the cost of milk production.  Paradoxically, this will, according to Rabobank, mean increased dairy imports in 2019.  Recent attempts at thawing out commercial relations between China and the US have resulted in some import concessions on US soya – but whether those suffice to improve Chinese production costs remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The below sums up the main indicators, many explored in some detail above, to assess what they indicate by way of milk price equivalent levels.  It is clear that, despite the last two positive auctions, the GDT levels still reflect significantly lower returns than EU indicators, showing a continued differentiation between markets.</p>

Some real positives on dairy markets for early 2019
1. Less milk about
Global supplies of milk have continued to grow into October, but, at an estimated +0.6%, this is at a very much more modest pace than heretofore.
Weather related fodder shortages and cost shocks continue to impact EU (-0.4% in Oct; +1.4% ytd), and Australian (-5.7% in Oct, -0.6% ytd) output.
While the US continue to show positive growth (+1.1% ytd), it is relatively modest at +0.8% for Oct.
Of the main dairy regions, only New Zealand is motoring on, up 5.8% for Oct, and up 2.2% for Jan-Oct.
Slightly less important in tonnages produced is Argentina, though Oct supplies were +2.1% – compared to a low performance this time last year – and ytd + 5.6%. Brazil was down 0.2% Jan-Sept.

Source: USDEC
European supplies, while well down on the whole for October, show a mixed picture when one look at individual producing countries.
France, Germany and the Netherland account for, between them 46% of the EU’s milk supplies, and 51% of its dairy exports.  Those three countries are all producing less milk this back end than last year, the Netherlands at least to end the year with less milk than 2017 – France produced 4.4% less milk in October, Germany -1% and the Netherlands -5.5%.
UK milk supplies were practically static at +0.4% for October, despite very strong growth in Northern Ireland, suggesting lower output in the rest of the UK.
Finland reported losing 50% of its grass crop to the drought over the summer, so that production will be down 0.5% this year and the Finns predict it will fall a further1.1% next year.
Austria’s milk supplies are also down, and the Italians expect their milk production to fall in the last quarter of 2018.
Supplies from other countries, on the other hand, have staged a recovery after the heat wave and drought of the summer.  Ireland most of all increased October production by 20.1%, raising January to October output by 2.8%, with expectations of further significant growth in November.  Denmark is also showing some growth, while Poland continue to grow production by over 2% ytd.

2. A turnaround in GDT trend?
Today’s GDT auction was the second positive one after a long stretch of price falls since last May.  Are we seeing a turn-around?  NZ supplies have increased massively in recent months, but we are now well past the NZ peak, and ahead of the Northern Hemisphere main season.  Concerns over slower and even negative supply growth in the short to medium term is clearly influencing even Oceanian price trends.
At US$3928 (€3454/t), the average GDT butter price is up 4.9% on the previous auction, but remains well below current EU average butter prices.  At $2042/t (€1796), GDT SMP prices are a little above rising EU levels.

3. More SMP selling fast out of intervention at rising prices
SMP has been open for buy-in since 2014, in the wake of the Russian embargo on all EU foodstuffs.  A total of over 405,000t was sold into intervention between 2015 and 2017.  There was no SMP accepted into intervention in 2018, and after a couple of unsuccessful tenders, operators got the message and stopped offering it in.
In 2016, 40t of SMP were sold out.  In 2017, this increased to a still modest 180 tonnes.  2018 saw the bulk of the sales, with 276,883t sold out by the last December 2018 tender.  From October, the number of monthly tender was doubled to 2, though December had only the one.
Next January, the totality of what is left in stock namely just over 102,000t, will be available for the next two tenders.
EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan has seriously suggested that the entire stock could be gone by next spring.
The most interesting aspect of the intervention sales is how they have increased in pace while the sales price has also been increasing.

Based on: EU MMO data
4. Rising fresh SMP market prices
SMP prices have been firming progressively since mid-October, coinciding with the largest sales out of intervention (see graph above).
As at 9th December 2018, the EU MMO reported the average EU SMP price at €1670/t.
Spot quotes for SMP have also been increasing steadily for the last couple of months.  On 12th December, those had exceeded the intervention buying in level and exceeded €1700/t for the first time in months.

Based on: EU MMO data

Source: INTL FCStone
Quotes for feed grade SMP have also been improving over the same period (see graph below).  It is fair to assume that the sales out of intervention cater mostly to this market.  And the minimum price reached in the December sale was very much on par with the type of prices currently being paid for the fresh product.

5. Demand somewhat flat currently but looking to improve in New Year
Demand growth had been assessed at around +1.5% earlier this year.  Lower oil prices, trade tariff disputes and weaker economic growth in many regions has flattened it a little in the last quarter of the year.
However, Chinese demand has increased in the earlier part of 2018, and is expected to increase in 2019 also.
Rabobank predict that, in 2019, Chinese demand will increase in double digits.  The cost of production is rising in China, with feed costs on the up partly as a result of the tariff/trade war with the US.  Chinese economic growth is however somewhat uncertain and this will impact demand for additional imports.  Even allowing for this, however, Rabobank predicts an increase in Chinese dairy consumption for 2019 of 1.5% year on year.

6. Not all rosy: Brexit, oil prices, international tariff wars
As 2018 comes to a close, there are some headwinds.
Brexit Day, 29th March 2019, is just over 100 days away, and the British, Irish Governments and the EU are now openly talking about preparing for the UK crashing out without a deal (a Hard Brexit).
It is worth reminding ourselves of a few dairy facts when it comes to our trade with the UK.

Oil prices had risen very significantly during 2018, increasing export earnings for many emerging countries which rely on them to import their food necessities including dairy products.
In recent weeks, increased supply and the fear of economic headwinds potentially reducing demand has impacted crude oil prices, which have fallen dramatically to levels last experienced over 12 months ago.
Crude Brent oil went from US$87.54/barrel on 3rd October to around US$58-59/barrel in early December.
While Saudi Arabia is believed to be unlikely to risk upsetting the US by pushing too hard for OPEC output restraint (which would push up oil prices), Rabobank and other analysts nonetheless expect 2019 oil prices to average out in excess of 2018.

<p> </p>
<p>While Brexit and international trade wars are creating some uncertainty, IFA National Dairy Chair Tom Phelan said there were many signs that dairy markets will be tighter and prices firmer into the spring of 2019. The Rabobank last Dairy Quarterly report for 2018 even says that dairy markets could move quickly upwards and catch buyers unaware in the first half of 2019.  This, Mr Phelan said, should encourage co-ops to hold milk prices at current levels till spring.</p>
<p><span id=""more-10200""></span></p>
<p>“Global milk supply growth is slowing down and coming back in tune with the current steady demand growth.  Rabobank shows that output from the big seven export regions (EU, US, NZ, Australia, Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay) is slowing dramatically at year end.  EU supplies in particular will be affected well into spring by weather related impacts on feed/fodder quantity, quality and cost.  The evidence is already there that France, Germany and the Netherlands, which between them account for 46% of EU milk production and 51% of exports, are producing far less milk at year-end, and even for the full year compared to 2017,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We are also seeing a very fast reduction in the quantities of SMP held in intervention stock which until recently had depressed the market.  Over 303,000t have been sold out, of which 60,500t this week alone, leaving just over 102,000t to be sold from January.  Commissioner Hogan recently stated that the full stock could be gone in spring 2019,” he added.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The minimum prices at which intervention SMP is being sold is fast catching up with fresh feed-grade powder prices of over €1450/t, and without preventing fresh food-grade SMP spot quotes from rising this week to €1700/t – intervention buying-in levels – for the first time in months,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“While butterfat prices are continuing to ease, butter at €4,640/t (latest EU Milk Market Observatory report) remains historically high,” he added.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I believe there are very good reasons to expect a positive start to 2019, and I call on all co-op board members who have yet to meet to decide on November milk prices to make a firm decision to hold them at current levels into spring,” he concluded.</p>

<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan today said that despite the Ornua PPI showing it lags behind firming powder trends for November, co-op board members preparing to decide on their November milk price must note that the case for a commitment to hold prices at least for the rest of the winter is getting stronger with more evidence of markets firming up.  After a year where extreme income volatility came from weather related cost factors, farmers will need the support and confidence boost which such a commitment from their industry would give them.</p>
<p>“At its Outlook 2019 event Teagasc rightly highlighted an expected 22% income fall for average 2018 dairy farm incomes, mostly due to a major increase in production costs linked to a 50% additional expenditure on fodder and feed,” he said.</p>
<p>“On the market side, yesterday’s positive GDT auction has shown that global butterfat prices in particular have turned a corner.  European food-grade SMP prices are continuing to firm to exceed €1600/t.  Much more rapid disposal of SMP from intervention stocks had been carried out at rising prices rapidly trending towards current fresh feed grade levels in excess of €1350/t.  EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan has even predicted all stock would be disposed of by spring,” Mr Phelan pointed out.</p>
<p>“We stated in recent weeks that output trends for year-end are well down in France, Germany and the Netherlands – which between them account for 46% of EU milk supplies, and 51% of EU’s exported milk.  The lower output levels for the last quarter of 2018 are mostly due to weather events and fodder shortages, combined for the Netherlands with the effect of herd reduction forced by phosphates restrictions.  Lower supplies and depleted intervention stocks have already, and will continue, to alter market sentiment in a positive way,” he said.</p>
<p>“Co-ops have supported farmers extensively during the fodder crisis of 2018, including through deferred repayments for inputs, free credit, rebates, even fodder imports, and this has been very much appreciated. However, farmers’ cash flows are in a bad way as the year comes to a close, with bills coming due, and lower seasonal milk volumes affecting milk cheques.  Co-op board members must recognise that farmers will need at worst stable milk prices over the coming months, and thankfully market trends make this a realistic expectation,” he concluded.</p>
</div>","
IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan today said that despite the Ornua PPI showing it lags behind firming powder trends for November, co-op board members preparing to decide on their November milk price must note that the case for a commitment to hold prices at least for the rest of the winter is getting stronger with more evidence of markets firming up.  After a year where extreme income volatility came from weather related cost factors, farmers will need the support and confidence boost which such a commitment from their industry would give them.
“At its Outlook 2019 event Teagasc rightly highlighted an expected 22% income fall for average 2018 dairy farm incomes, mostly due to a major increase in production costs linked to a 50% additional expenditure on fodder and feed,” he said.
“On the market side, yesterday’s positive GDT auction has shown that global butterfat prices in particular have turned a corner.  European food-grade SMP prices are continuing to firm to exceed €1600/t.  Much more rapid disposal of SMP from intervention stocks had been carried out at rising prices rapidly trending towards current fresh feed grade levels in excess of €1350/t.  EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan has even predicted all stock would be disposed of by spring,” Mr Phelan pointed out.
“We stated in recent weeks that output trends for year-end are well down in France, Germany and the Netherlands – which between them account for 46% of EU milk supplies, and 51% of EU’s exported milk.

<p>Speaking following this week’s Brussels-based COPA Milk Group meeting of Europe’s dairy farmer representatives, IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan stated his fellow-farmers had confirmed lower production trends into the autumn and winter, due to drought, fodder shortages and lower milk prices, which should influence dairy markets positively.  Mr Phelan reported that most attendees predicted stable to firmer milk prices to year-end, and Irish co-ops should have the confidence to hold milk prices till then at least, too.</p>
<p>“At the meeting, our fellow-European farmer representatives told us that in France, drought and disappointing milk prices caused milk production to fall 4% in September and 5% in October.  Dutch milk production is down 2.5% due to the phosphates restrictions, but also to a 10 to 20 % drought-related fodder shortage,” he said.</p>
<p>“German dairy farmers expect their 2018 output will be down 1.45% below 2017.  In the UK, despite growth in Northern Ireland, overall supplies are stable.  Finnish dairy farmers have lost half of their grass crop to the drought, and expect supplies to fall 0.5% this year, and by 1.1% next year.  Production also fell in Austria, is expected to fall for the next 3 months in Italy, and while Poland continues to increase output, it is by a more modest 2% for the year to September,” he added.</p>
<p>“Clearly, the full impact of the drought is only transpiring after it has ended. Despite many countries reporting improved rainfall since August or September, the earlier dry spell continues to impact on fodder and the availability and cost of feed and grain,” he said.</p>
<p>“My conclusion is that many dairy farmers around Europe will struggle to sustain production with disappointing prices in the face of scarce fodder and high-priced feed.  This means lower volumes for the next number of months, and scarcity always pushes up prices,” he said.</p>
<p>“In this context, co-ops can, and must, commit to holding their milk prices at least to year end,” he concluded.</p>

<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan today (Friday) said the decision by the board of Aurivo to cut their October milk price by just over 1c/l is at odds with the other main milk purchasers’ call and will disappoint their suppliers in one of the most difficult farming and financial years.</p>
<p>“IFA’s research has shown that, just like the other main milk purchasers other than the West Cork Co-ops, Aurivo had paid farmers less than the Ornua PPI milk price equivalent for the period from May to September 2018.  By our calculations, a 350,000l Aurivo supplier would have received just under €1700 more over that period had they been paid the Ornua PPI milk price equivalent – the October price cut will compound this further,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“It is crucial that other co-ops take their lead from Glanbia, Lakeland, Kerry and Dairygold, all of which have held their October prices.  Aurivo and all other co-ops must now commit to holding their milk price for the rest of the winter,” he added.</p>
<p>“Butterfat prices have eased, but SMP average, spot and futures market prices have all been firming, aided by a massive destocking of SMP out of intervention.  There are reasons to be optimistic about powder markets for 2019, and this must help co-ops to hold milk prices for the coming months,” he concluded.</p>

<p>IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan today (Tuesday) pointed out that, other than the 4 West Cork Co-ops, no other Irish milk purchasers had returned the August Ornua PPI equivalent price of 31.78c/l + VAT for 3.3% protein and 3.6% butterfat milk, never mind the September 32.70c/l + VAT average returns for dairy products, as reported by the EU Milk Market Observatory (see graph below left).  He added that, as European milk purchasers were continuing to raise milk prices for September, October, and in some cases to year end, farmers in Ireland were entitled to wonder whether they were being short-changed by their co-ops in one of the toughest years for cash flow and morale.  1c/l on September milk is fully justified, and should be paid on base prices by all co-ops.</p>

<p><span id=""more-9903""></span></p>
<p>“As we approach full employment, Irish agriculture, especially our labour intensive and or expanding sectors such as dairy, horticulture and pigs, have a genuine need of additional labour from outside the EEA (European Economic Area).  The introduction by Minister Heather Humphreys of a pilot labour permit scheme for the agriculture sector last May was a positive first step in this regard.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joe Healy particularly welcomed the recommendation to modify the 50:50 rule to extend the waiver to include all sole operators in expansion mode and to develop a seasonal employment permit to provide for non-EEA nationals to work here temporarily. Waiving the 50:50 rule would be very beneficial to the dairy sector, while the horticulture sector would benefit from a seasonal scheme similar to the SAWS in the UK or the RSE scheme in New Zealand.</p>

IFA President Joe Healy has welcomed the announcement by Lakeland and LacPatrick that their boards had agreed merger terms, to be put to their respective shareholders for a vote on 23rd October.

Mr Healy said: “The merger proposal being recommended to shareholders by both co-op boards must put the merged entity in the best possible position to optimise dairy processing and pay a strong price to farmers.  This is particularly critical in the context of Brexit, as both co-ops have farmer members and processing facilities both sides of the border”.
 
IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan added: “Dairy farmers in the North East have a proven record of quality milk production.  In this respect, I must congratulate wholeheartedly the McKenna family from Derrygasson, Co. Monaghan, suppliers to LacPatrick Co-op, the winners of the Kerrygold/NDC Milk Quality Awards”.
 
“Dairy farmers in the region need to know that the co-operative business they charge with collecting, processing, adding value and marketing their milk is optimally efficient.  This merger proposal must convince shareholders in both LacPatrick and Lakeland that this is the way forward,” he said.
 
Mr. Phelan concluded by saying that it is important that both co-ops ensure that farmer members are fully informed of the detailed provisions in the merger proposal over the coming days, to be able to make a properly informed decision on 23rd October.

<p><strong>A mixed outlook – modest output growth, but moderating prices</strong></p>
<p>Global milk output growth has continued to moderate into July, indicative most of all of the impact of drought and heatwaves in Europe.  More modest US growth (+0.4%) also played a part, and a drop in Australian production for July (down 4.2%).  Fodder is short and feed expensive in Australia due to unfavourable weather factors.</p>
<p><span id=""more-9881""></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, July New Zealand output was well up (+4.5%).  July is the first month of the new season, and the outlook is expected to be for strong continued output over the coming months, with a strong pasture growth index at a 5-year high. NZ production is due to peak in October, which is only next month.<a href=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Global-supplies.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-77533 lazy"" data-src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Global-supplies.png"" height=""426"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""626""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-77533"" height=""426"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Global-supplies.png"" width=""626""/></noscript></a></p>

<p>Speaking after this week’s IFA National Dairy Committee meeting, Chairman Tom Phelan said representatives from all around the country were vocal and frustrated: dairy farmers’ backs are to the wall, and only higher milk prices – <strong>starting with 1c/l for August milk</strong> – will help with the massive expenditure increase on fodder and feed necessary to keep the milk flowing. <span id=""more-9842""></span></p>
<p>“Teagasc last week revealed that dairy farmers would spend an average of 75% more on feed in 2018 – this is cash many simply do not have.  Our Committee reps testified to the financial and mental pressures suffered by farm families trying to keep cows fed while dealing with the family and back to school/college demands on their cash flow,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“European markets have been firming in recent weeks with most European indicators for early September (EU Milk Market Observatory, spot quotes and futures) suggesting milk price equivalents around 33-34c/l net of VAT – that’s at least 2c/l more than most co-ops are paying,” he added.</p>
<p>“When European milk purchasers have been increasing July, August and in some cases already also September prices, and when Arla are planning to pass back the totality of their estimated €300m 2018 profits back to farmers, Irish farmers cannot be left behind by their co-ops,” he said.</p>
<p>“So, the National Dairy Committee voiced the following demands to co-op boards, which will be meeting in coming days to decide on milk prices:</p>
<p><strong>1 – Roll all top ups/bonuses back into the base milk price</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 – Return back to farmers the true value of improved dairy prices – we believe that is at least 1c/l on August milk</strong></p>

<p><strong>4 – Over the coming months, eliminate the unsustainable gaps which co-ops have allowed to develop between their milk prices”.</strong></p>
<p>“The Committee recognises the efforts made by co-ops to support farmers through the near 12-month fodder crisis.  However, the financial and mental pressures on many farmers demand higher milk prices to help them buy the fodder and feed they will need to sustain autumn supplies.  Markets justify higher prices, and co-ops must deliver them without delay,” he concluded.</p>

<p>Speaking today (Wednesday) from the Virginia Dairy Show in County Cavan, IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan said co-ops had taken fright earlier this summer and been overly conservative in just holding base prices, some making do with temporary “support” payments which could readily be whipped out. <span id=""more-9799""></span> Kerry’s Eamonn Scanlon and Glanbia’s Siobhan Talbot have recently expressed confidence in the market place, borne out by the latest European quotes, despite yesterday’s negative GDT.  This must lead to higher milk prices from August supplies.</p>
<p>“I think it is important to put GDT auctions in context.   The USDA predicts that over 7.5m tonnes of dairy products will be traded globally in the year ending December 2018.  The quantities traded through GDT in 2017 were less than 10% of that,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“Latest European market trends show drought has moderated volumes from June and helped the prices of most commodities rally this month.  All co-ops, especially those whose base prices have been allowed fall behind, must increase their August base price and be ready to increase it further before year-end as markets allow,” he said.</p>
<p>“The Ornua PPI published in August for July trade was slightly down, but as always lags behind market trends.  In recent weeks, most product prices have rallied.  The EU Milk Market Observatory most recent report (15<sup>th</sup> August) shows high butter prices easing slightly, but SMP prices up €80/t ,WMP up €40/t, cheddar cheese by €30/t and whey powder by €20/t.  Altogether, these prices would return <strong>37.5c/l gross</strong> for an Irish product mix (or <strong>32.5c/l + VAT</strong>, assuming a 5c/l processing cost deduction),” he said.</p>
<p>“Spot prices – the current price for a product without a forward contract – are also up, with Dutch raw milk rising €5.8/100 kgs to €37.8/kg.  Spot quotes for European dairy products are also lifting, with 15<sup>th</sup> August quotes up by between 2.6% (butter) and 3.52% (SMP).  Returns before processing costs for SMP/butter, based on the average Dutch, German and French spot quotes on that date, would be <strong>38.82c/l gross</strong>, or <strong>33.82c/l + VAT</strong> after deduction of 5c/l processing costs,” he added.</p>
<p>“Finally, the newly launched EEX Liquid (Raw) Milk Futures currently suggests October to December prices of over <strong>€36-37/100 kg</strong>, rising to <strong>€40/100 kg</strong> next spring,” he said.</p>
<p>“It is clear that reduced production from June due to drought in Europe is impacting market sentiment and dairy prices.  Co-ops must ensure that farmers benefit from this, seen as the impact of weather on feeding costs in particular will hit their 2018 margins hard,” he concluded.</p>

<p>Commenting on the eve of the Virginia Dairy Show, which he will be attending tomorrow, IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan expressed some concern at the EU Commission’s proposal, to be agreed this autumn, to extend to 2019 its SMP intervention buying in policy in order to further deplete stocks and prevent short term build up. <span id=""more-9790""></span> He said it was very clear to him this must not mean a lesser EU Commission commitment to intervention as part of its market management tool kit.  Mr Phelan called on Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed and his officials to insist that this commitment be reiterated by the EU Commission as part of this proposed temporary measure.</p>
<p>“IFA takes the view that effective, responsive recourse to intervention when markets require it is a crucial part of the CAP tool box to protect farmers’ incomes from the severe market slumps, as we have seen in 2009 and in 2016, and will no doubt see again as market, weather and geopolitical volatility continue to impact dairy prices,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“In this respect, we are concerned by the proposal to extend to 2019 the temporary 2018 measure which saw a zero limit to the quantity of SMP the Commission is committed to purchasing at the reference price of €1698/t.  We also take a strong view that this should not become a template for the post 2020 CAP market management measures,” he stated.</p>
<p>“We understand and support, in the current dairy market context, the importance of driving down overhanging intervention stocks of SMP and preventing further build up.  However, we believe the Minister and DAFM officials should insist on the EU Commission reiterating its commitment to market management through judicious and responsive recourse to intervention buying-in, among other tools, both to prevent and deal with market crises,” he concluded.</p>

<p>Mr Phelan said it was particularly vital that milk suppliers benefited from all those decisions.</p>
<p>“Glanbia have this month taken the first step in addressing the costly milk price gap they had left their suppliers to deal with in recent months.  Not only did markets fully justify the price increases delivered, and would justify more over the next few months, it is clear that farmers are in desperate need of a cash flow boost to keep cows fed after freak weather events from winter to summer this year undermined both grazing and fodder production for 2018.  In this respect, the €20m advance credit package to support feed and fertiliser purchases over the coming weeks will be welcomed by farmers,” he said.</p>
<p>“With regards to the Glanbia Plc/Leprino joint investment in Laois, it must do more for farmers than provide an outlet for larger volumes of milk.  Farmers must be assured that the higher value returns will be shared fairly with them, as they will have been achieved largely based on leveraging farmers’ efforts on quality and sustainability through their adoption of SDAS.

<p>Weather events continue to moderate US and EU milk output into Summer<span id=""more-9670""></span></p>
<p>Milk supplies for April 18 lifted a little for the EU 28, at +2.1%. In the US, the growth was quite modest for April (+0.7%) and in May (+0.9%).  Together with a 4% increase for April/May 2018 in New Zealand, this has led AHDB to predict a slight recovery from the trend to March.</p>
<p>However, I would venture to guess that dry and hot weather in North Western Europe, and wet weather in other parts of Europe in May and June will probably moderate growth in the EU 28 again for those months.</p>

<p>EU and international commodity prices have been strengthening since the beginning of the year, in response to strong demand and moderate production growth, especially in the EU 28.</p>
<p>EU average dairy commodity prices as reported to the EU Milk Market Observatory (EU MMO) at 24<sup>th</sup> June (most recent available as we write) suggested a gross return before processing costs are deducted of 37.93c/l for a reasonably representative Irish product mix.  This was despite a slight easing that week of butter, SMP and WMP prices. After deduction of a nominal 5c/l processing cost, this would be equivalent to a price level of <strong>32.93c/l + VAT (34.70c/l incl VAT).</strong></p>

Weather events continue to moderate US and EU milk output into Summer
Milk supplies for April 18 lifted a little for the EU 28, at +2.1%. In the US, the growth was quite modest for April (+0.7%) and in May (+0.9%).  Together with a 4% increase for April/May 2018 in New Zealand, this has led AHDB to predict a slight recovery from the trend to March.
However, I would venture to guess that dry and hot weather in North Western Europe, and wet weather in other parts of Europe in May and June will probably moderate growth in the EU 28 again for those months.

<p>IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan has said that in participating voluntarily to the Farmers’ Journal/KPMG 2017 Milk Price Review, co-ops are contributing to providing unique milk price transparency, which is the envy of our European colleagues. He commended all co-ops for their continued commitment to the Review year after year.<span id=""more-9620""></span></p>
<p>“The IFJ/KPMG Milk Price Review is the most robust measurement of the true average milk pay-out to farmers by each co-op, as it simply divides up the creamery milk purchasing expenditure into the volumes of milk purchased, excluding liquid milk,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“For farmers, though, at a time when base milk prices have fallen by at least 5c/l since September, the 2017 Review is mostly of historical interest. I call on the Farmers’ Journal and KPMG to speed up the process and aim to have the Review published by the end of January from next year,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Milk price gaps</strong></p>
<p>“There has been disappointingly little progress in addressing last year’s 6c/l gap between top and bottom payers: this year, it is 5.5c/l. But developments this year so far show co-ops are again potentially on the path to greater divergence. Co-ops have to work a great deal harder to do to increase milk prices and narrow the costly price gaps – starting with the June milk cheque.</p>
<p>“I would expect co-op boards at their next meeting to review their long term milk pricing plan, and for the shorter term to be sure to pass back a price increase of at least 1c/l for June milk which current market returns clearly justify,” Tom Phelan concluded.</p>

<p>IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan today (Tues) said that the improvement in all international dairy market indicators makes price increases imperative at this point. He stressed that they are also absolutely necessary as farmers’ milk receipts are squeezed and production costs bumped up by drought. “An increase of 1c/l at the very least is fully justified for June to begin with,” Tom Phelan said.<span id=""more-9611""></span></p>
<p>“Through May and June, we have seen a continued general improvement in market returns, especially for butter – now stabilising – and powders. The Ornua PPI has improved 5 points for May to 105.4 or 31.4c/l incl VAT. It has been predicted by new CEO John Jordan to rise further for June and the following months,” he said.</p>
<p>“EU and global commodity markets have been strengthening, with the EU MMO returns up by just over 5c/l since January – more than half of the reduction seen over lower volumes between September and December 2017. Latest figures suggest a milk price equivalent, including VAT, of 34.63c/l,” he added.</p>
<p>“Dutch, German and French spot quotes, based only on SMP and butter prices, suggest a milk price equivalent over 37c/l including VAT,” he added.</p>
<p>“Despite a slight easing of prices in the last two GDT auctions, the 19th June prices for the SMP/butter combination would yield an Irish price equivalent of 33.5c/l including VAT,” he said.</p>

<p>Improved market returns must be used by co-ops to allow farmers to benefit from the upturn in dairy markets, but also to help narrow the costly milk price gaps that have developed between co-ops in recent months, IFA Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan has said.<span id=""more-9612""></span></p>
<p>Reporting on IFA analysis of the price gaps between co-ops, Tom Phelan said, “A farmer supplying an average of 350,000 litres, whose May production accounts for 13.7% of annual output, faces base value discrepancies varying from €879 less to €487 more when compared to the average of the 8 main co-ops’ base prices for the month of May.”</p>
<p>This analysis deliberately excludes the weather and fodder supports paid on May milk supplies by some co-ops as they are unlikely to last into the future and takes account only of base milk prices net of VAT for milk at 3.3% protein and 3.6% butterfat.</p>
<p>Tom Phelan said, “We excluded the weather/fodder supports in this comparison because they are unlikely to survive as top ups into June but we would argue that they should be incorporated into the base price for June milk. In addition, prices must be further lifted to reflect significant improvements in market returns.</p>
<p>“Co-ops will be deciding on June milk prices in a week or two, and this is their chance to start improving their base price to reflect stronger dairy prices.</p>
<p>“Co-ops must also address the price gaps that have developed. According to our analysis, if the gaps between the prices paid by the main 8 milk purchasing co-ops persist for the rest of the year, a farmer receiving the lower of the 8 prices would earn €4,749 less than if he had received the average price. Meanwhile, if he received the highest of the 8 prices, he would earn €2,632 more than if he had received the average price.”</p>
<p>“This is an unlikely scenario, and would not be tenable, but co-op boards must bear it in mind in their decisions. Farmers need them to pay a competitive milk price as well as a milk price that fairly reflects the improved value coming back to co-ops in recent weeks. While there is no question that the Farmers’ Journal’s KPMG Milk Price Review is the best measurement, our Committee is adamant that it is simply unfair to be asking farmers to wait more than a year to satisfy themselves of the relative competitiveness of their co-op’s milk price,” Tom Phelan concluded.</p>

<h4>World Markets Overview June 2018</h4>
<p>A marginal decline in world total grains production is predicted in 2018/19 with supplies are down 1% due to tighter opening stocks.</p>
<p>Global total grains (wheat and coarse grains) production in 2017/18 was 2% short of the previous year’s record, but heavy stocks at the start of the season saw overall supply rise for the fifth year in succession. However, given sustained consumption growth set to be at a new high, the first world stocks contraction since 2012/13 is predicted. Trade (Jul/Jun) will be the highest ever, including record shipments of maize and barley.</p>
<p><span id=""more-9630""></span></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""size-full wp-image-76873 aligncenter lazy"" data-src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/picture1.png"" height=""437"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""572""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""size-full wp-image-76873 aligncenter"" height=""437"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/picture1.png"" width=""572""/></noscript></p>
<p>Total grains production in 2018/19 is projected to be below the season before as a reduced wheat harvest is almost balanced by better out-turns of maize, barley and sorghum. But taking account of reduced opening stocks, total supply is set to decline to a three-year low.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-76874 lazy"" data-src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Picture2.png"" height=""422"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""939""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-76874"" height=""422"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Picture2.png"" width=""939""/></noscript></p>
<p>The global carryover is therefore seen coming down for a second year, taking inventories to a four-season low.</p>

World Markets Overview June 2018
A marginal decline in world total grains production is predicted in 2018/19 with supplies are down 1% due to tighter opening stocks.
Global total grains (wheat and coarse grains) production in 2017/18 was 2% short of the previous year’s record, but heavy stocks at the start of the season saw overall supply rise for the fifth year in succession. However, given sustained consumption growth set to be at a new high, the first world stocks contraction since 2012/13 is predicted. Trade (Jul/Jun) will be the highest ever, including record shipments of maize and barley.


Total grains production in 2018/19 is projected to be below the season before as a reduced wheat harvest is almost balanced by better out-turns of maize, barley and sorghum. But taking account of reduced opening stocks, total supply is set to decline to a three-year low.

The global carryover is therefore seen coming down for a second year, taking inventories to a four-season low.

<p>IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan has pointed out that the slight softening shown by the two June GDT auctions does not change the fact that international dairy commodity prices are continuing their recovery.<span id=""more-9558""></span></p>
<p>He said the main commodities traded through GDT have seen price uplifts of up to 25% (butter) since the beginning of the year, reflecting the trends now well established in Europe. Co-ops can, and must, start reflecting higher returns by paying farmers higher milk prices from this month.</p>
<p>“Despite the 1.2% average fall in the GDT index, the price reached yesterday by butter and SMP in the auction, in combination, would return an Irish milk price equivalent of 33.5c/l including VAT, after deduction of a nominal 5c/l processing cost,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p>“Since the earlier part of the year, GDT butter prices have risen over 25%, Cheddar cheese by 16%, and even weaker SMP by over 8%.</p>
<p>“At European level, spot SMP quotes have continued to firm, last week reaching €1600/t in Germany and France; while butter is holding firm at a historically high average of €6170/t. Combined, and after deduction of 5c/l for costs these would return an Irish milk price of 36.6c/l + VAT.</p>
<p>“Using the EU Milk Market Observatory’s reports for last week also, a more representative product mix including cheese, whey and WMP as well as SMP and butter, would return an Irish milk price after deduction of processing costs of 33.06c/l + VAT.</p>

<p>In April, however, some important producing countries, especially around Europe have registered a decrease in output.  Hence Irish milk supplies were back 5.9%, and French output is estimated down 1.6%, with an expected 0.6% decrease for May.  UK April production is estimated at 0.8% below the same month last year, with May predicted to be down 0.3%.</p>

<p>The view expressed by most analysts is that the turn around in dairy price trends in the last few months is down to this overall decreased global production growth, coupled with continued strong demand from emerging countries, especially China and SE Asia, with other countries better able to afford food and dairy imports as a result of improved oil export earnings (higher oil prices, now reaching between US$75-80 per barrel).<a href=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brent-Crude-Oil-prices.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-76685 lazy"" data-src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brent-Crude-Oil-prices.png"" height=""459"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""366""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-76685"" height=""459"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brent-Crude-Oil-prices.png"" width=""366""/></noscript></a><strong>SMP intervention stock – substantial disposal likely by year end</strong></p>

<p>Fonterra have revised the 17/18 pay-out (price + dividend) to NZ$6.90-6.95/kg MS (equivalent to roughly 30c/l incl VAT at Irish standard constituents); and announced their first price forecast (no dividend yet) for 18/19 at NZ$7.00/kg MS (30.5 c/l incl VAT).</p>
<p><strong>Scope for price increases for Irish farmers</strong></p>
<p>The Ornua PPI for May rose 5 points to 105.4 points, equivalent to a VAT exclusive milk price of 29.8c/l.  This was a few points more than anticipated even only a few weeks ago, and is yet another sign that Irish co-ops are benefiting from the improved market returns we have been highlighting in this blog for a couple of months now.</p>
<p>Spot SMP/butter on 6<sup>th</sup> June 2018 would return a gross equivalent of 41.5c/l before deduction of processing costs.  The average EU returns as reported by EU MMO for 10<sup>th</sup> of June around 38c/l – also before processing costs.</p>
<p>It is very clear that steadily improving returns are now translating into higher priced contracts between processors and their customers.  Some co-ops have held their May payout, some even rolling in their bonus of last month into the base, a welcome move which secures it for future months.</p>
<p>It will be important for all co-ops to start leveraging those improved returns to pass back strong price increases on June milk and beyond</p>

Friesland Campina have announced an increase in June milk prices of +€0.25/100kgs to €34.25/100kgs, while Arla Denmark announced a 1c/kg uplift.  For UK Arla suppliers, this translates into an increase of 1.15ppl.  (Get actual prices for both here).  Any July price increase announcement by those?
First Milk (UK) have announced a 1.2ppl price lift for July to 28.58ppl (32.85c/l) .
Fonterra have revised the 17/18 pay-out (price + dividend) to NZ$6.90-6.95/kg MS (equivalent to roughly 30c/l incl VAT at Irish standard constituents); and announced their first price forecast (no dividend yet) for 18/19 at NZ$7.00/kg MS (30.5 c/l incl VAT).
Scope for price increases for Irish farmers
The Ornua PPI for May rose 5 points to 105.4 points, equivalent to a VAT exclusive milk price of 29.8c/l.  This was a few points more than anticipated even only a few weeks ago, and is yet another sign that Irish co-ops are benefiting from the improved market returns we have been highlighting in this blog for a couple of months now.
Spot SMP/butter on 6th June 2018 would return a gross equivalent of 41.5c/l before deduction of processing costs.  The average EU returns as reported by EU MMO for 10th of June around 38c/l – also before processing costs.
It is very clear that steadily improving returns are now translating into higher priced contracts between processors and their customers.  Some co-ops have held their May payout, some even rolling in their bonus of last month into the base, a welcome move which secures it for future months.
It will be important for all co-ops to start leveraging those improved returns to pass back strong price increases on June milk and beyond

<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan has said that co-ops owe it to their suppliers to reflect in their May milk price decisions the 4.8c/l increase in EU returns and the several points higher than expected 105.4 pts May PPI.<span id=""more-9518""></span></p>

<p>“We in IFA have been highlighting for weeks just how much improvement has occurred in the average EU market prices for the commodities relevant to the Irish product mix.

<p>IFA National Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan today (Wednesday) said co-op boards, meeting within the next week to consider May milk prices, must leverage the improved market returns of the last number of weeks to ensure that, at the very minimum, that the totality of the April payout – base price plus support – is maintained for May milk supplies.</p>

<p><span id=""more-9439""></span></p>
<p>“The National Farm Survey from Teagasc shows strong dairy incomes for 2017, for what are mostly full-time farms.  However, these figures are historical, and the downturn of volatile dairy markets has cut base milk prices by up to 6c/l in the first four months of this year.  Across an entire year’s supply, this kind of cut would cost a 500,000l milk supplier €30,000 straight off the bottom line,” Mr Phelan said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The downturn of late 2017 is well and truly over.  Last week, we heard the April Ornua PPI had stabilised, which was a clear sign that returns available to co-ops have bottomed out, and current market trends suggest they will improve,” he said.</p>

<p>“EU spot and average market quotes have been firming for weeks.  Average EU dairy returns, based on the EU MMO average market quotes for an Irish product mix of butter, SMP, cheddar cheese, whey and WMP have recovered by over 3.5c/l since January.  This mix would return a milk price equivalent of 31.5c/l + VAT based on the latest 13th May figures, after deduction of a nominal 5c/l processing cost,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Last week’s spot quotes are also well up, with latest Dutch, French and German butter prices averaging just under €6,000/t and SMP just under €1,500/t. This would be equivalent to a milk price of around 35c/l + VAT,” he added.</p>

<p>IFA President Joe Healy today (Tues) said the preliminary results of the Teagasc 2017 National Farm Income survey highlighted the critical importance of CAP direct supports across all farming sectors and the dangers of hugely volatile or weak price returns.</p>
<p><span id=""more-9431""></span></p>
<p>Joe Healy said with the major challenges from Brexit and the CAP post-2020, the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed and the Irish Government needed to work twice as hard to secure a positive Brexit outcome and an increase in the CAP budget.</p>
<p>“The increase in average farm income for 2017 to €31,300 comes off the back of a difficult year in 2016.  Farming on the whole remains a low-income activity, with average earnings well below the average industrial wage,” he said.</p>
<p>“The 2017 figure is influenced by the positive performance from dairy farms, the vast majority of which are full time, with higher volumes and better prices after a difficult year in 2016.  It also illustrates the extreme income volatility which challenges dairy farmers: milk prices have been cut by up to 6c/l this year already, and spring volumes have suffered from the bad weather.  EU market supports and voluntary risk management tools, including through national tax-based measures, must be developed to help farmers cope with those sharp swings in cash flow,” he said.</p>
<p>Joe Healy said the Teagasc income figures on livestock clearly demonstrate the dependence of dry stock farmers on direct payments and the need for strong additional support for suckler farmers.

<p>After several years of low returns, the tillage sector has seen a badly needed income uplift of 20% which reflects improved yields rather than better prices.</p>

<p><strong>SMP stocks moving at last</strong></p>
<p>SMP prices seem set to recover – though slowly – as intervention stocks are starting to move in earnest at long last.</p>
<p>In the most recent tender, which closed 15<sup>th</sup> May and was adjudicated yesterday, the EU Commission received bids for 124,360t, with prices offered ranging from €500/t to €1277/t.  The minimum price selected by the EU Commission for adjudication was €1155 – €100 above the April tender – which resulted in 41,598t of SMP being sold between the €1155 and the top price bid.  In fact, the bids exceeded the amount of product available by around 5,000t (there was insufficient stock of the right age in certain countries relative to the bids within the eligible price range).</p>
<p>This means that, since December 2016, over 76,000t of SMP has been sold out of intervention – of which around 65,000t in the last 2 tenders alone.</p>
<p>The EU Commission is expected to increase the quantities available for the June 19<sup>th</sup> tender to around 149,000t.  It will do so by bringing forward the eligibility date for the stock from product purchased before 1<sup>st</sup> May 2016 to before 1<sup>st</sup> June 2016.</p>
<p>Buyers are clearly engaging more with the scheme, and willing to pay more as the fresh market picks up.  This is very positive and holds the prospect that a substantial volume of SMP in intervention could be disposed of before year end.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, traders had been pointing out that the EU intervention stock had become largely irrelevant to the fresh market – and this was showing as SMP prices started firming slowly.</p>

With global milk output growing at much slower rates (just over 1% for March, the level analysts believe is required to rebalance markets), intervention SMP stock shifting more readily, and international commodity price indices on the up, it looks like we may have seen the last of the (base) milk price cuts for 2018.

Source: USDEC
 
EU dairy commodity prices as reported by the EU MMO have continued to firm.  Butter prices have gone up by over €1000/t since January, while SMP has lifted €120/t in the last month (see graph based on EU MMO reports below).
 

SMP stocks moving at last
SMP prices seem set to recover – though slowly – as intervention stocks are starting to move in earnest at long last.
In the most recent tender, which closed 15th May and was adjudicated yesterday, the EU Commission received bids for 124,360t, with prices offered ranging from €500/t to €1277/t.  The minimum price selected by the EU Commission for adjudication was €1155 – €100 above the April tender – which resulted in 41,598t of SMP being sold between the €1155 and the top price bid.  In fact, the bids exceeded the amount of product available by around 5,000t (there was insufficient stock of the right age in certain countries relative to the bids within the eligible price range).
This means that, since December 2016, over 76,000t of SMP has been sold out of intervention – of which around 65,000t in the last 2 tenders alone.
The EU Commission is expected to increase the quantities available for the June 19th tender to around 149,000t.  It will do so by bringing forward the eligibility date for the stock from product purchased before 1st May 2016 to before 1st June 2016.
Buyers are clearly engaging more with the scheme, and willing to pay more as the fresh market picks up.  This is very positive and holds the prospect that a substantial volume of SMP in intervention could be disposed of before year end.
In recent weeks, traders had been pointing out that the EU intervention stock had become largely irrelevant to the fresh market – and this was showing as SMP prices started firming slowly.
There’s a long way to go, though.  With EU average prices (13th May) averaging at €1440 and latest spot quotes (16th May) at €1490, only this week’s GDT price at US$ 2047 (€1734) exceeds the intervention reference price.[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Returns inching up
The returns for the Irish product mix, based on EU MMO reported average EU prices, have lifted half a cent per litre in the last week alone.  This is largely driven by increases in butter, SMP and whey powder prices.

Based on EU MMO Data

<p>The latest IFA Dairy Market Report asks are SMP markets on the mend at last?<span id=""more-9362""></span></p>
<p>SMP prices have languished well below €2000/t since June 2017, after which they staged a free-fall.  They have been below €1500 since November.  In the last few weeks, average EU SMP prices as reported by the EU MMO have first stabilised just over €1300/t, and in the last couple of weeks have even staged a small recovery to €1380 (29<sup>th</sup> April 2018).  Could it be that we’ve seen the worst of the SMP prices?</p>
<p>While we all hope so, there are a number of indicators which suggest that we might just be right to be optimistic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SMP-historical-prices.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-42879 lazy"" data-src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SMP-historical-prices.png"" height=""1034"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""1424""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-42879"" height=""1034"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SMP-historical-prices.png"" width=""1424""/></noscript></a></p>
<p>Based on EU MMO data</p>
<p>While we all hope so, there are a number of indicators which suggest that we might just be right to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Spot markets too have been rallying of late, now reaching €1420/t on average for the Dutch, German and French quotes on 2<sup>nd</sup> May 2018.  This is around €200/t above the early April quote for SMP.</p>
<p><a href=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/spot-quotes.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-42880 lazy"" data-src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/spot-quotes.png"" height=""134"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""639""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-42880"" height=""134"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/spot-quotes.png"" width=""639""/></noscript></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Source:FCStone</p>
<p>What is also very interesting to observe is the buyers’ attitude to the SMP intervention stock.  The last tender, on 17<sup>th</sup> April last, saw for the first time a significant amount of product sold (24,066 t, compared to just around 10,000t sold over the 17 preceding months).  Even more meaningful was the price at which the product sold: poor at €1051, but stable/up for the first time in those 17 months.  Furthermore, the range of prices buyers were prepared to bid at reached above the intervention reference price of €1700 for the first time since last September.</p>
<p>It would seem that buyers are now prepared to pay more for SMP intervention stock.  Some operators have suggested that sellers are now finding it a little easier to dismiss the relevance of SMP stock because it is aging rapidly, and is no longer real competition for the fresh stuff.  Facts appear to prove them right!</p>
<p>Looking at global market trends for SMP, GDT auctions over the last couple of months have shown stronger prices than even European prices. At US$1,999/t at the auction of 1<sup>st</sup> May, it would be equivalent in Euros to €1670/t.</p>
<p>The GDT butter and SMP price combination reached on 1<sup>st</sup> May would be equivalent to a gross Irish milk price return (before processing costs are deducted) of 35.65c/l.<a href=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GDT-SMP-price.png""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-42881 lazy"" data-src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GDT-SMP-price.png"" height=""433"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/wprig/assets/images/placeholder.svg"" width=""813""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-42881"" height=""433"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://kz8gz1ero0r33u0gx211vaey-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GDT-SMP-price.png"" width=""813""/></noscript></a></p>

<p><strong>Positive EU price trend extends beyond SMP</strong></p>
<p>Other EU dairy prices have also improved somewhat in April.</p>
<p>Butter prices are nearing €5200/t, a price over twice the butter price of two years ago, WMP has inched up to €2700/t during the month, while whey powder has lifted slightly to finish the month $700/710/t.  All commodity cheese prices have held up well during the month, too.</p>
<p>Returns in terms of cents per litre do reflect the improved average returns – however, where operators have sold on forward contracts signed some weeks back, those would have been at somewhat lower prices.  Hence the Ornua PPI may well end up trailing slightly the EU average returns over the coming weeks, just as it was slightly ahead of them when prices started to ease in the last quarter of 2017.</p>

The latest IFA Dairy Market Report asks are SMP markets on the mend at last?
SMP prices have languished well below €2000/t since June 2017, after which they staged a free-fall.  They have been below €1500 since November.  In the last few weeks, average EU SMP prices as reported by the EU MMO have first stabilised just over €1300/t, and in the last couple of weeks have even staged a small recovery to €1380 (29th April 2018).  Could it be that we’ve seen the worst of the SMP prices?
While we all hope so, there are a number of indicators which suggest that we might just be right to be optimistic.
 

Based on EU MMO data
While we all hope so, there are a number of indicators which suggest that we might just be right to be optimistic.
Spot markets too have been rallying of late, now reaching €1420/t on average for the Dutch, German and French quotes on 2nd May 2018.  This is around €200/t above the early April quote for SMP.

 
Source:FCStone
What is also very interesting to observe is the buyers’ attitude to the SMP intervention stock.  The last tender, on 17th April last, saw for the first time a significant amount of product sold (24,066 t, compared to just around 10,000t sold over the 17 preceding months).  Even more meaningful was the price at which the product sold: poor at €1051, but stable/up for the first time in those 17 months.  Furthermore, the range of prices buyers were prepared to bid at reached above the intervention reference price of €1700 for the first time since last September.
It would seem that buyers are now prepared to pay more for SMP intervention stock.  Some operators have suggested that sellers are now finding it a little easier to dismiss the relevance of SMP stock because it is aging rapidly, and is no longer real competition for the fresh stuff.  Facts appear to prove them right!
Looking at global market trends for SMP, GDT auctions over the last couple of months have shown stronger prices than even European prices. At US$1,999/t at the auction of 1st May, it would be equivalent in Euros to €1670/t.
The GDT butter and SMP price combination reached on 1st May would be equivalent to a gross Irish milk price return (before processing costs are deducted) of 35.65c/l.
Source: GDT
Positive EU price trend extends beyond SMP
Other EU dairy prices have also improved somewhat in April.
Butter prices are nearing €5200/t, a price over twice the butter price of two years ago, WMP has inched up to €2700/t during the month, while whey powder has lifted slightly to finish the month $700/710/t.  All commodity cheese prices have held up well during the month, too.
Returns in terms of cents per litre do reflect the improved average returns – however, where operators have sold on forward contracts signed some weeks back, those would have been at somewhat lower prices.  Hence the Ornua PPI may well end up trailing slightly the EU average returns over the coming weeks, just as it was slightly ahead of them when prices started to ease in the last quarter of 2017.
 

Based on EU MMO data
EU returns at end April equivalent to 30c/l + VAT
Taking account of recent price improvements, the average returns before processing costs for a representative Irish product mix based on the most recent data for 29th April quoted by the EU MMO now exceeds very slightly 35c/l – or, excluding a nominal 5c/l processing cost, would be equivalent to 30.22c/l + VAT.
While co-ops may have contracts which were signed for lower returns than those, it would appear at least that those will progressively be replaced by higher priced contracts.
This should give co-ops the confidence to continue supporting milk prices, which farmers still suffering from the consequences of the disastrous spring need badly.

<p>IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan has warned co-ops that they must not kick farmers while they’re down by cutting milk prices, but must instead utilise some of the strongly increased 2017 profits to show their understanding of the extreme hardship and stress levels on farms in the only way that will count for dairy farmers: by holding the March milk price.<span id=""more-9239""></span></p>
<p>Farmers appreciate the support co-ops have given through various fodder initiatives. However, the goodwill generated by these moves will be utterly destroyed in farmers’ minds by any price cut.</p>
<p>“Farmers have had to contend with unprecedented hardship this spring, after what was an early and long winter. Most have run short or altogether out of fodder and are only now – over a month late – seeing ground temperatures that will hopefully allow for some grass growth in the coming days. The stress among farmer is approaching burn-out levels as they have got no relief since the busy calving season,” he warned.</p>
<p>“Teagasc have put the reduced profitability for each day that the cows are not grazing at between €2.20 and €3.00 per cow. Hence for a 100-cow herd, a three-week delay in turn out, for example, would cost the farmer around €5,500. The true nature of the losses may be greater as some herds have lost more than three weeks’ worth of grazing since last autumn. Also, they will certainly rise further in the longer term, as fodder production capacity, cow condition and possibly cow fertility also suffer,” he added.</p>

Joe Healy said, “We cannot rely on the weather picking up to solve the problem. We need to stop the megaphone diplomacy and sit down now to have constructive engagement to see what can be done”.
The IFA President said while there is no magic bullet to solve the current problem, farmers need to see leadership from the Minister, who has to bring everyone together to come up with coherent and practical action that can help farmers at this time.

<p>“The milk price decisions some co-ops took for February milk have shown just how out of touch they are with the massive challenges to their economic sustainability suppliers have been experiencing for the last number of months,” IFA National Dairy Committee Chairman Tom Phelan has said. He said it is at least as important for co-ops to invest in their suppliers as it is to invest in stainless steel.<span id=""more-9170""></span></p>
<p>“When setting the March milk price, Co-ops cannot make the same mistake as they did last month. IFA Dairy Committee members will encourage fellow dairy farmers within their county to join them in meeting or otherwise contacting every board member and some of the members of the outer boards or other co-op committees over the coming days to lobby them and drive home this point: co-ops must slow down and minimise any further milk price adjustment.</p>
<p>“At our meeting last week, members of the IFA Dairy Committee were very clear that, while market returns continue to be challenging in this early part of the season, co-ops need to invest in farmers to help them cope after a horrendously long winter, late spring and a hectic calving season made worse by atrocious weather which left many exhausted and stressed.</p>
<p>“Members from all regions have reported having to complement feed at high cost to themselves as fodder stores have been depleted as cows were brought in early last autumn and had to be kept in till late this spring. Despite this additional feeding, protein levels have plunged in March according to most co-ops. Without any price cut at all, farmers will be looking at a depressed milk cheque for March.</p>
<p>“Co-ops have been lecturing farmers about sustainability: now they must ensure that sustainability is also about the economic viability of dairy farmers, including for the long term. This must mean supporting farmers through difficult conditions such as were experienced in the last 7 months, and in the short term minimising any adjustment to March milk prices,” Tom Phelan concluded.</p>
