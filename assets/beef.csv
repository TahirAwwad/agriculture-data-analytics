"IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden has welcomed the announcement by the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue that buyers can return to the mart ring from Mon, May 17th. “This is an important part of the re-opening of the country and it will help the normal flow of trade in marts, along with the online facilities that will remain in place,” he said. IFA raised the issue of allowing buyers and sellers into the marts at a recent meeting with the Tánaiste Leo Varadkar. He said the phased return to the normal operation of marts is a recognition of the responsible actions of farmers and marts throughout the lockdowns. He reminded everybody attending the marts to adhere strictly to the public health guidelines and controls that will be in place."
